We have made a few changes to remove some exploits in our continuing effort to remove any loopholes in EverQuest. 
In this update we have removed the charm exploit in Plane of Tactics by changing the way that charm works. This 
change should not affect those who use charm in the manner for which it was intended. We have also changed the 
profit margin of many tradeskill items when sold to NPC vendors. It is our hope that these changes and your 
continued community efforts will help to put a stop to those who do not wish to play fairly. 

- Changed Charm spells so that NPCs spell use will now be interrupted once the charm has expired. 

- We have modified the sell back value on many tradeskill items to prevent excessive profit. 

- Please note that many items will now show as being usable by berserkers. This does not necessarily mean the items 
will be equippable by berserkers when Gates of Discord launches.

** Incremental Download for Gates of Discord ** 
We have begun introducing the Gates files in small bits. This is the most convenient way for you to get the files 
you'll need for the new expansion. It is a lot easier to download these files in smaller chunks than to download 
them all on the day of release. 
You can get the files incrementally from the EverQuest updater. The obvious way to begin downloading the files is 
to click "yes" when the dialogue box pops up asking you if you'd like to incrementally download Gates. If you've 
already told that dialogue never to appear again, you can get the files in a few easy steps: 
- Run the EverQuest Updater 
- Click the Advanced button 
- Click the checkbox next to Gates of Discord 
- Click Save 
- Click Download. 
This will catch you up on the downloads you have missed and will update you as we add files to the updater. 
This will make your download much smaller the day Gates launches, or the day you purchase the digital version 
of the expansion. 

The anticipated release date -- February 10th, 2004 -- is subject to change. If the anticipated release date 
changes, we will announce a revised release date via a patch message.

Tonight we have a small update to fix some general bugs. We are again changing charm (in exactly the way we thought 
we had last week) No this is not deja vu. You should also look for changes in that evolving zone of Nedaria's Landing. 
I wonder what is going on there? 

- An update to the zone, Nedaria's Landing. Make sure you check it out. 

- Charm spell change: If an NPC is in the middle of casting a spell when charm is broken, it will interrupt the spell. 

- Some general bug fixes. 

Make sure you log onto the Test server to see what other changes we are cooking up. Our next Scheduled update is 
planned for February 10th. 

Remember Gates of Discord is coming soon. Go to www.gatesofdiscord.com or EQlive.station.sony.com for more information.

Return of the Casino 
------------------------ 

** Play King's Court in Shadowhaven! ** 

Shandeling's Roost in Shadowhaven again houses a game of chance. To play you will need to buy a King's Court Token. 
You then take this token and turn it in to any of the dealers. Based on what your hand turns out to be, you will be 
awarded a prize. The highest hands will return a gold ticket as the prize. This Ticket can be turned in to win 
prizes such as a Guise of the Deceiver, Fungus Covered Great Staff, or Holgresh Elder Beads. Good luck to all that play! 

Tradeskill UI now live 
------------------------ 

Opening a tradeskill container will now open a new user interface. In the window you will find an area that has 
all recipes that are currently available to you. This includes recipes that are at your skill level as well as 
some above it. Clicking on a recipe will display what items are necessary for its completion. Clicking the "combine" 
button will extract those required items from the player's inventory, and perform the recipe combine, placing the 
results on the player's cursor. The new system is nice and neat, with no dragging and dropping unless you want to 
try a combine that is way out of your league, which uses the old style of combination. 

Item Changes 
------------------------ 
- The name of Berserker armor has been changed to Bladesmans armor. 
- The beastlord epic weapon will no longer "proc" for wielders below the 46th level. 
- Many text changes in item descriptions. 

General Bug Fixes 
------------------------ 
- A Tormentors hoof is now flagged as a tradeskill item. 
- Chaotic Stab, a rogue AA, will no longer cause full damage on frontal attacks. 
- Altered some NPC factions in the Plane of Tactics arena to prevent a problem with charm.

------------------------ 
- Fixed some text on the Focus Will Discipline. 
- Assassins Strike should now work correctly. 
- Sneak Attack should now work correctly. 
- Thief's Vengeance is now working correctly. 
- Indirection should now work as intended.

Tribute Update

The Tribute system as it was released has caused a greater variance in favor distribution than was intended. 
In order to make the system more healthy, fair, and balanced, there will be changes made over two updates -- 
one today and one next week.

The following changes have been made today:

- Favor Maximum: There will be a maximum limit of 200,000 favor that a player character can have available at 
any time. If a player has accumulated more than 200,000 favor at the time of this change, the character will 
retain its favor, but will not be able to add to it until it falls below 200,000.

- Favor Value Adjustments to Items: Some items have had their favor value adjusted to be more appropriate. For 
this update, this will not affect the favor amount that a player has gained by handing in items that have had 
their favor values adjusted.

For next week's update, we will be adjusting each character's favor amounts based on any items that were handed in 
to Tribute Masters that have had their favor values adjusted.

We hope you continue to enjoy the benefits of the Tribute system and Gates of Discord.

In other words: Play, raid and be merry, for tomorrow we nerf.

.....................................................................

We found a bit of code that was, occasionally, causing random zone crashes and corrected it. We are still working 
on the second part of the 1017 problem and hope that many of you found some relief in the changes we made last night. 
Thanks again for your patience. We're working hard to solve the problem. 

Monks once again irresistible. (Phantom abilities should no longer be resisted.) 

Small change to berserker epic text.

Headlines 
------------------------ 
Combines work again! 
Melee Part II! 
A new story has been added to your storybook! 


The grammar police have invaded EQ and they have made many minor spell, item and quest text fixes that are too 
numerous to list here. 

We'd like to thank all of the players that took time to provide feedback regarding the melee changes. We'd also 
like to send a special thanks to all of the players that helped us test the additions on the Test and Beta servers. 
All of the input we received helped to shape the improvements you've seen in the melee classes. 

Please continue to give your feedback on the melee system or anything else that you feel requires attention. 
It does make a difference. 

Over the last several months there have been several new additions to EverQuest aimed at increasing the desirability 
and relative power of pure melee classes. 

- Discipline timers were revamped, allowing greater freedom and frequency of use. 
- Endurance bar was added as a limited resource to power melee abilities and disciplines. 
- Warriors received an innate 5 percent increase in their ability to absorb damage. 
- Warriors received the Incite line of abilities, giving them a new tool for aggro management. 
- Monks received the Phantom Call line of abilities, giving them a new tool for pulling. 
- Several new disciplines were introduced for all three classes. 

The endurance system and the separation of the discipline timers have provided us with new tools to add interesting 
and powerful abilities in the future for melee classes. You can count on seeing new disciplines and abilities as the 
game progresses and as situations arise that require new abilities to effectively balance class power. We will 
continue to evaluate the melee system for both balance and enjoyment. 

We will also continue to review and make changes to each individual class as needed. Class balance is an important 
part of any multiplayer game and requires constant attention. 

Thanks for helping make EverQuest a great game. 


Items 
------------------------ 
We have replaced the spell-like effects on items which produced the following effects: Attack, HP Regen, Mana Regen, 
Haste and Damage Shield with actual statistics. The effects on the item have not changed they are just set up in a 
new way that we hope will allow for more item functionality in the future. 

Several Gates smithed weapons have had their damage and delay adjusted to be more in line with the difficulty in 
crafting them.
 
The Copper Hammer of Striking will no longer proc for wielders below level 50. 

The Wailing Coral Staff is now two handed blunt. 

Bolas are now one-handed projectile rather than ammo. 

Bola ranges have been adjusted slightly. 

All bolas that can proc will now do so. 

All items that had the "Cleave" series of effects removed, have had them returned. 

The drop rate for the following Epic Quest items has been increased slightly: 

- Essence of a Vampire 
- Decrepit Hide 
- Staff of Elemental Mastery (earth) 


Expedition zones 
------------------------- 
You will now have to wait 5 minutes before you are able to accept another expedition zone. 


Tradeskills 
------------------------- 
In order to correct many of the issues with the new tradeskill interface it was necessary to remove all learned and 
favorite recipes. However the system should now work better overall. 

The sell prices for Saltwater Tuna and Saltwater crab, as well as the price for any item made from them, have been 
reduced. 

Rainbow Trout should now be tradeable. 

If you are not a gnome, you should no longer be able to tinker with a deluxe toolkit kit. If you are a gnome, 
please tinker away. 

You should now be able to properly search for recipes. 

The trivial level for brewing Fish Wine has been adjusted. 


Berserkers 
------------------------- 
Some berserker abilities have had their endurance cost changed. 
The duration of Confusing Strike has been reduced. 
Berserkers should no longer be told that they can bash at level 6. 
The berserker guildmaster in the Plane of Knowledge has been taught throwing and parry and is ready to train 
berserkers in their use. 


Spells 
------------------------- 
Some Gates of Discord spells should now drop a little more often. 
Several heal spells for Gates of Discord have been modified slightly. 
The shadow knight Ancient Spell: Bite of Chaos should now work as intended. 


NPC's 
------------------------- 
Hierophant Granix should now give the correct text in Cabilis. 
Trimdet Trueheart in Abysmal Sea is less of a snob and should now speak with you correctly. 
If you tell Brevik Kalaner in Abysmal what items you [need back], he will return to you any items you've just given him. 


Tribute 
------------------------- 
A few items have had their tribute value adjusted. 
Gift of the Enchanters should now work correctly. 
You should no longer be able to donate containers with items inside for favor. 
Persistent Boon should now give the proper effect. 


Alternate Advancement 
------------------------- 
Dire Charm will no longer reset after being resisted as the ability was successfully initiated. 
Dire Charm should now reset when used on an NPC that is too high in level. 


Miscellaneous 
------------------------- 
Corrected a faction issue with the wizard epic. 

The monk "Phantom" line of abilities should no longer be resisted in the level 65 "hard" LDoN Adventures. 

The rogue's "Assassin's Strike" skill line ability will be re-introduced with the next update. 

The Shining Bloodstone will now be restricted to 2-handed weapons. Any who have placed this augmentation in a 
1-handed weapon will find the augmentation on their cursor when they log in. If you find that you have no practical 
use for the 2-handed augmentation, please petition and a suitable 1-handed replacement will be made available to you.

Headlines 

-Refining some DX9 functionality. 

-Some adjustments have been made to pets. 

-Some general bug fixes. 

-Added a new rogue discipline line, Assassins Strike. The tomes can be found in the East Commonlands and the 
Plane of Knowledge. 


DirectX 9 
-The center of collision for all players 
-We have made improvements to position processing which should alleviate some of the problems related to getting 
stuck in geometry. 
-Improved collision and movement when near overhangs. 
-The auto-duck mechanism is now an user-enabled option. It can be set in the General tab of the options window. 
This feature forces your character to duck automatically to get into small places. If set to off, you will need 
to manually duck to enter those places. It is "on" by default. 
-Warping of very small NPCs (e.g., giant rats in Qeynos) has been resolved. 
-Rain now has visible weather. 


Pets 
60+ player pets have been improved in a number of ways. Most notably, the effects of pet foci will be more 
dramatic as a player progresses with more powerful equipment. There have also been a number of inconsistencies 
between different tiers of pet foci that have been fixed. All of the existing foci should never show a power 
decrease in any aspect when upgrading from a lower tier foci to a higher tier foci. The most dramatic changes 
in pet stats are in the following aspects: 

Level - Most tiers of Foci will add one level to the pet. 

Max HP - Most tiers of foci will add max hit points to the pet, some tiers are more dramatic than others and follow 
a similar rate of progression to player characters as they gain equipment equivalent to the pet focus items. 

Mitigation (AC, Agility) -- Most tiers of foci will add mitigation to the pet. Some tiers are more dramatic than 
others and follow a similar rate of progression to player characters as they gain equipment equivalent to the pet 
focus items. 

Damage Output - Generally the pets did not receive a significant change in their damage output, although there are 
certain pets that have had their max hit and offense increased. 

Overall, the player pets have received a significant boost. There are instances where you will see no change in a 
specific aspect of a specific pet. For example, the Rathe’’s Son pet summoned with Minion of Eternity has not received 
an improvement in max hit points, but it has received a significant mitigation improvement. 

These changes affect the pets summoned by the following spells: 

Ward of Xegony 
Child of Ro 
Servant of Marr 
Rathe’s Son 
Legacy of Zek 
Saryrn’s Companion 
Child of Bertoxxulous 
Spirit of Sorsha 
Spirit of Arag 

The most profound changes were made to the magician pets as they were most in need of improvement to maintain class 
balance. Beastlord and necromancer pets also received upgrades, but not of the same magnitude.

- You can now bandage yourself up to 70% of your HP. Folks with the appropriate AA abilities can bandage above 70%. 
- You can now bandage while sitting. 


/rewind 
/rewind is back and should help if you find yourself stuck. This is not an automatic rewind, you will have to 
execute the command. We are continuing to work on other collision issues and hope to no longer need /rewind in the 
near future. This command is only able to be used once every 30 seconds, and in order to make use of it, your character
will need to be stationary for at least 30 seconds.

Headlines! 
Gates of Discord content retuned! 

Gates of Discord 
- Zone experience modifiers were increased in all zones from Tipt/Vxed and beyond. 
- Natimbi, Qinimi, Barindu, Riwwi, and Ferubi should be tuned more appropriately for their intended level ranges. 
- NPCs will no longer hit for max damage as often. Knights in particular should find it easier to tank the NPCs 
they previously had difficulty with. 
- Ikkinz -- Guilds no longer have to flag every member in order to complete the Ikkinz trials. Only one person needs 
to complete all events/raids to start the seventh Ikkinz trial. At that point, all players who complete the seventh 
trial will get full credit for the zone. 
- NPC innates have been adjusted to behave a little more reasonably. 
- Zone travel has been made easier. Animal aggression was lowered by changing their faction and See Invis percentages 
were reduced on several NPCs. 
- Spell drops have been increased. 
- Increased the rate of cash drops. 
- The mini bosses in Qvic now have a more appropriate respawn rate. Their item drop rate has been increased to 
compensate for this. 
- Breakdown in Communication quest now has improved rewards! 

Collision 
More improvements to the collision system should make it a lot more difficult to get stuck. 

Misc. 
The Eye of Zomm will once again open closed doors.

Tutorial 
- Does your significant other find EQ too hard to learn? Our new Tutorial is Live and ready to teach them to play. 
Creating a new character will give you the option to go through the new tutorial. You can choose to leave the tutorial 
at anytime and can return until your character reaches level 5. The tutorial will walk you through gameplay with easy 
to follow instructions in text and voice. 
- Hybrids will now receive mana at level 1 as they now receive a spell in the tutorial. 

CS Assist 
A new CS tool is available for use and should provide you with a better interface when petitioning. You can also 
access our self help option through the knowledge base. You can bring up the new window by pressing the 'P' key, 
typing /petition, or clicking the "Customer Service" button from the help window. 

Cabalis Quests 
Iksar Warriors and Necromancers have some quests to finish! 
Iksar Beastlords have a new quest. 


UI Changes 
- There's a new button in the Options->Display tab to toggle between full screen and windowed mode. 
- Presto Change-O! There's a new button on the bazaar window to hide all traders. Clicking a trader in the search 
window will make them appear (limited to the last trader you clicked) 
- New text filters have been added for Pet Crits, Pet Rampage/Flurry, System Messages, Focus Effects, Exp Messages, 
and Who list.

Improved Collisions 
- Most collision issues should now be resolved. 
- Collision system improvements have made elevators much safer. 
- Getting out of water should be a little easier for short races. We wouldn't want all those Halflings to drown, now 
would we? 
- Rogues should be able to more easily exit water while sneaking, although I think it would be hard to sneak with wet 
trousers. 

Misc. 
- You now have the ability to "AutoBank" in the Bank Window. 
- Casting a spell while sitting will stand you up. 
- Camping while standing will sit you down automatically.

Collision fixes collide with servers! 


Collision 
- When you are summoned by NPCs or players smaller than you, the collision system will now scan a limited area near 
the destination to find a place to put you so that you will not be stuck in the terrain. 

- A problem related to collision data being out of sync on the client and server has been corrected and should solve 
the problems many of you have been seeing with NPCs being pushed into walls. 

- The sunken NPC and character problem has been much improved. You will still find the occasional NPC at a spawn point 
that is sunk or elevated slightly, but the NPC should move normally once engaged. 


Cabilis Quests 
- The Battle plans from Dalnir should be a little easier to obtain. 
- The loyal follower in Dreadlands should no longer be a merchant with an empty inventory. 
- The traitor necromancers seek should be a little easier to find. 
- Wyzith's belongings should now combine correctly.
