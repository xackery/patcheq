** Bug Fixes **

- The "NPC unerringly sticks on pet" AI bug implemented in the last 
patch has been fixed. This resolves a bug that occurred a short while 
ago that would cause pets to be the focus for most attacks by NPCs.

- Fixed the animation problem where an animation played on the upper 
body would get stuck. This could be seen by starting to cast a spell 
and then walking forward while it was playing the casting animation.

- Fixed a bug that wouldn't allow a player to target an invisible PC or 
NPC with the F7 or F8 keys even if they had See Invisible up.

- Stacking issues with 'change form' type spells have been corrected. 
Lich and Clarity will no longer stack, nor will Spirit of Wolf and Wolf 
Form.

- The bug with screenshots that some people experienced when using 32-
bit color mode should be fixed.

** Item and Vendor Adjustments **

- Changed the forged Antonian Javelins to be stackable.

- Gnome Skin Sleeves are now droppable and rentable.

- Spiderling and Spider Silks are now stackable

- Spider Legs are now stackable.

- Tarnished weapons worth slightly more to the vendors than the rusty 
ones.

- Reduced the weight of the monk only Black Pantherskin armor.

- All Sheets of metal and Folded Sheets of metal are now stackable.

- Rangers will now be able to wear Girdle of Reflection

- There is now a vendor in Felwithe that sells the Enchant Ores series 
of enchanter spells.

** Zone and Quest Changes **

- The Crazed Ghouls should be less of a problem in Unrest.

- The Monk red headband quest should now be available again.

- We've added a few more Yew Leaf spawns.

- Reevaluated the values of the various fish fillets. All fish vendors 
should return to normal, but they won't be paying as well for certain 
fishy items. This resolves a problem that was created with the 
increased value of player made food items all over Norrath. Some of 
food items were made too valuable, and merchants were complaining to 
their union leaders...

a Magician only summon corpse potion usable only at levels over 45th.

a slightly better chance to resist spells cast on them by higher level 
characters.

it's yours to keep, even if it clashes with your favorite eye shadow.

spell on another Player Character on Sullon Zek. Resist modifiers based 
on level will now be more smoothly distributed and will allow lower 
level characters a slightly better chance to land spells on higher 
level characters. At the same time giving lower level characters a

Located on the small continent of Odus, the Stonebrunt Mountains are 
rich with vegetation and distinctive hills that give way to the 
towering Mount Klaw; the largest mountain in Odus and home to the 
Kerran village of Kejeka. The zone of Stonebrunt is designed to be a 
mid-level, outdoor zone similar in scope and scale to the Lake of Ill 
Omen on Kunark, which has proven to be a very popular zone in 
EverQuest.

** Spell Changes **

- Changed all enchanter mesmerization spells so that they overwrite 
Screaming Terror

- Changed Shaman epic effect (Curse of the Spirits) so that it would 
not conflict with certain Damage over Time spells.

- The Emissary of Thule Necromancer pet is now immune to fear

- Beneficial buffs that don't have an ability drain component on them 
can now be clicked off.

** Miscellaneous Updates **

- The server selection screen now only gives information on whether or 
not a server is up instead of providing player counts. In addition, the 
"count" option on the /who command has been restricted to internal 
personnel. Servers on the server selection screen are still ordered 
from least-populated to most populated in order to assist players in 
choosing the least populated server.

- Harla Dar has been repaired (this happened sometime earlier than 
today, but we wanted you to know).

- Reactivated broken zone line between Qeynos to the Sewers. A dead 
halfling was stuck in the drainpipe and has been removed.

- Fixed a long-standing bug that was causing Feign Death to fail when 
several characters were on the NPC's hate list along with the character 
using Feign Death. We'd like to extend much thanks to the monk 
community who helped us track this one down. Also fixed a problem with 
the monk's 'Block' skill which inadvertantly was recapped at a lower 
than normal skill level in recent months. Kudos to "Faned" of the 
"Monkly Business" bulletin board who brow-beat Gordon with the facts 
until he gave in and looked at the code :)

- As announced earlier this week, the Belt of the Cenobite was made 
useable by some inappropriate classes/races in the last patch. This has 
been corrected.

- Several quest components in zones with the Trivial Loot Code will now 
be lootable regardless of level.

September 11, 2001  Terrorist Attack Response
------------------------------

"The staff of Sony Online Entertainment wish to extend their 
condolences and prayers to the victims, and the families of the 
victims, lost in today’s horrific events. We share in your grief during 
these difficult times."

The quote from our front page expresses how we all feel here in the 
office. I only want to extend my personal sympathies to all the 
families that this has touched.

We have received many letters, and I want to thank you all for sending 
them in. It's obvious that we will all be different people from here 
forward. If I don't dwell on this in my responses here it is only 
because I know that none of us will forget what has happened, and that 
you come here for entertainment not reminders of tragedy.

Sony Online Entertainment, is asking for your help in locating someone 
involved in the recent terror:

Sony Online Entertainment needs your help in locating Gregory Trost. 
Gregory is a nephew of an SOE employee and his last known location was 
the 86th floor of Tower Two in the World Trade Center. With the tragic 
events that took place on September 11, the Trost family is anxious for 
any information regarding Gregory. If you have any information on 
Gregory's whereabouts, please contact Sony Online Entertainment at this 
special address. greginfo@station.sony.com

[Editor Note: Gregory Trost was later found to be among the nearly 3000 
people killed in the World Trade Center disaster.]

** Spell Changes **

- We have removed the changes to bard song stacking that were made with 
the recent emergency patch. We will be reviewing those changes for 
possible update in a future patch.

** Item Changes **

- The Shaman Epic effect has been returned to its previous effect (and 
it should conflict with fewer Damage over Time spells, as was the 
intention for the change made last patch).

** Quest Changes **

- Ivory Sky Diamond is now dropping as it should.

- Fixed an error in a Stonebrunt quest where an NPC was handing out the 
wrong reward.

** Miscellaneous **

- Added some code that might fix a bug with female hair and Erudite 
hoods that caused them to fail to appear sometimes when a helmet was 
removed. This would cause some characters to look as though the back of 
their head was missing at times.

- Mouselook will now work a little differently when in the first two 
third-person camera modes (overhead and chase). They will work 
similarly to first-person mouselook (i.e. your character's heading will 
change when you move the mouse left or right, the left and right 
movement keys will cause your player to strafe, and the camera angle 
will pitch up or down when you move the mouse forward or back). These 
changes should make those first two third-person camera modes more 
useful.

Firiona Vie server is available on Test now:

Or it will be very shortly...
You can get to this server by running testeverquest.exe from your 
EverQuest directory. Please read the Test Server disclaimer (available 
in the Test Server patch message) carefully before playing on the Test 
Server.

Here is part of the message from the Test Server.

*** Firiona Vie Server ***

The new Firiona Vie Server is now available for testing. As usual, 
please keep in mind that this is a Test server and we will be changing 
things as time goes by. The Test Server Disclaimer shown above applies 
to this server as well. Please be aware that when the server 'goes 
Live' all existing characters from the beta periods will be removed.

There are many special rules for this server. We will be keeping an 
updated list of these rules on our Developer's Corner message board. 
Please head over to www.everquest.com and head to the message boards 
for the most recent information about this server.

Here is the preliminary list of rules. To read this information later, 
you can refer to the testeqnews.txt file in your EverQuest folder.

* Firiona Vie Server Feature List *

This is a new server, not a split server. Nor will there be any 
transfers to this server.

Characters will be wiped before the server goes Live.

This is a PvE (Player vs. Environment) server, NOT a PvP (Player vs. 
Player) server. In other words, it's a standard 'blue' server with the 
same rules and features regarding PvP as the vast majority of our 
servers. It is not one of the 'Zeks'. 

Auction restricted to city zones: Qeynos, Surefall Glade, Highkeep, 
Freeport, Rivervale, Erudin, Halas, Neriak, Grobb, Oggok, Greater 
Faydark, Ak'Anon, Kaladim, Felwithe, Paineel, Cabilis, Kael and 
Thurgadin. 

Beneficial buff spells will not work on characters 20 levels lower than 
the caster. 

Each character will be assigned an "alignment" upon creation. This 
alignment will be described in brief on the character creation screen 
(in the same location the their Deity is described).

Each character will be able to change their alignment once any time 
after they reach 10th level if they choose. A character is not required 
to change alignments, but may do so any time after attaining 10th 
level. The player will be able to chose from a list of alignments based 
on their race, class and deity. 

A character's alignment will determine whether or not they can group or 
guild with other characters. (Note: The Guild portion of this code has 
not yet been implemented, and no guilds will be forming on this server 
until we can get it working).

A character's alignment will determine an experience bonus or penalty 
when grouping with other characters. 

A character's alignment will determine if they can cast beneficial 
spells on other characters (including resurrections). 

Language skills will improve only through group chat in the same zone 
and from /say. 

Languages will only improve 1 point each hour and will be capped at 
level*5+5 skill points. 

Common will not exist. A Human language will be added and only made 
easily available to certain races. 

One character per account. 

The Trivial Loot Code will be in effect in all zones. 

Very few items will be No-Drop. Exceptions will include things such as 
newbie notes and epic weapons.

Bind Affinity will be restricted for all characters to locations where 
melee characters can bind on other servers. 

/emote will be language specific 

All characters will be /roleplay. 

/alignment will display the alignment of your character and probably a 
more detailed description of that alignment. 

* Trivial Loot Code *

Briefly, the Trivial Loot Code works like this: If a character kills an 
NPC and that NPC does not give them experience, then the Trivial Loot 
Code takes effect. If any member of a group does not get experience for 
a kill, the Trivial Loot Code will take effect. The Trivial Loot Code 
prevents magical, lore and no-drop items from appearing on the corpse. 
Normal items and coins will appear on the corpse in all cases as usual.

October 5, 2001  Press Release - Graphics Upgrades
------------------------------

THE WORLD OF EVERQUEST® GOES HIGH RESOLUTION WITH EVERQUEST: THE 
SHADOWS OF LUCLIN™ EXPANSION

-Old World Environments To Rival Luclin's Beauty With Improved 
Graphics-

SAN DIEGO, CA - October 5, 2001- Sony Online Entertainment Inc., (SOE) 
announced today that EverQuest®: The Shadows of Luclin™ will launch 
with an additional CD-ROM featuring a complete upgrade to all textures 
throughout the original world of Norrath and all previous expansions.

"We are pleased to make this surprise announcement," said Brad McQuaid, 
Chief Creative Officer & Vice President, Sony Online Entertainment. 
"EverQuest players will be amazed at the clarity the texture upgrade 
provides and we feel the gameplay experience will be richly enhanced."

When EverQuest originally shipped in 1999, the development team 
utilized 32 x 32 low-resolution pixels because of graphics technology 
at the time. With the advent of superior graphic cards, the upgraded 
texture resolution featured in EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin will be 
256 x 256 pixels and occasionally as large as 512 x 512 pixels. This 
vast improvement in quality will make Norrath appear more vibrant and 
detailed than ever before.

"We have gone through the entire game and applied the new higher 
resolution textures by hand," said Scott McDaniel, EverQuest Art Lead, 
Sony Online Entertainment. "The sheer size of EverQuest has made this 
upgrade quite a project. To see the old zones in high resolution is 
really exciting for the entire team."

EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin features over 24 new zones, rideable 
mounts, all new character models, new facial animations, and over 120 
new spells and will be available on retail shelves in December 2001. 
For more information visit the official Shadows of Luclin website at . 

The Station (www.station.com) is the official provider of EverQuest, 
with software updates and news about the game, message boards and other 
community features, as well as an easy-to-use billing system for

------------------------------

*** Item Changes ***

- Increased the duration on Song of the Deep Seas (the proc on a bardic 
weapon) dramatically.

- Modified the effect of Feast of Blood (weapon proc) it is now a DoT 
lifetap

- Added a texture to Flayed Barbarian Skin Leggings.

- Added Illusion: Barbarian to the Flayed Barbarian Hide Mask.


*** Miscellaneous Changes ***

- The last language used by your character will be stored in your 
eqclient.ini file when you log out. This means that if the last 
character you were playing was speaking Elvish, then when you log back 
in with any character, that character will be speaking Elvish if he 
can, otherwise it will be set to a default language (most often 
Common).

*** Magic System Changes ***

There is a more detailed explanation of these changes posted on our 
Developer's Corner. Please visit there for more details (either at 
www.everquest.com or http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-
bin/Ultimate.cgi). Here is a summary of the changes:

- The level-based spell resistance bonus inherent in super-high level 
NPCs has been reduced significantly.

- Several NPCs have had their resistances reduced. Each of them was 
examined carefully, and resistances changed as seemed appropriate. For 
some of these NPCs other things were changed as well to compensate for 
their increased susceptibility to spells, such as armor improvements or 
perhaps greater hit points, if needed for that NPC.

- NPCs that were highly magic resistant in order to make them immune to 
certain spells can now be given specific immunity to those spells. This 
means that they can be made immune to critical spells, as intended, and 
still be generally less resistant to magic. Players will receive a 
message similar to the one that is already given for Mesmerization 
spells when they cast a spell on an NPC that it is specifically immune 
to.

IMPORTANT NOTE: It is very important to note that we have not made any 
NPCs immune to spells that they were not already immune to. Many NPCs 
that were previously immune to spells due to their high innate 
resistance to magic have had that resistance reduced and specific 
immunities added. So if you see an immunity message after attempting to 
cast a spell on an NPC that you hadn't seen such a message from before, 
understand that the NPC was already immune to that spell before due to 
high resistances, and the only difference is that it now has lower 
resistances in general and specific spell immunity (which is why you 
are seeing the message).

*** Melee Changes ***

After extensive research, testing, and evaluation we have completed the 
melee portion of our class balancing. To be clear, these changes apply 
just to the combat aspect of melee classes. Any issues with non-combat 
skills, spell effects, spell selection, or non-combat aspects of 
classes will be evaluated in the near future. With the completion of 
the melee combat balancing, we will be moving onto spells and spell 
casting classes. 

Due to the extensive nature of these changes, we can't describe them in 
detail here. A detailed summary will be available on our Developer's 
Corner message board. Please visit www.everquest.com and our forums for 
more information.

* Summary of Melee Changes *

- Two-Handed Weapons have been given an increased damage bonus for 
characters over level 50. Also, certain post-epic quality two-handers 
have been improved.

- Warriors have had their taunt skill cap increased to 230 at 60th 
level. Also, the Blades of Strategy and Tactics can now be used in 
either hand.

- Rogues, as the primary user of piercing weapons, will benefit from an 
improvement in the quality of a few existing high-end daggers. At some 
future date new piercing weapons will be added to the game to fill gaps 
in equipment availability.

- Monks will now be on an improved combat table at levels 55 and again 
to a better table at 60. Monks now have the ability to Triple Attack at 
60th level. The minimum damage done by Flying Kick will be greatly 
increased for monks starting at 51st level and scaling up to level 60. 
We also intend to add more monk weapons in the future to fill equipment 
gaps.

- Rangers have their Double Attack skill cap raised to 245. They have 
also gained an innate offensive bonus that starts at level 55 and 
increases until level 60. Ranger's Defense skill cap has been raised to 
220, and their Riposte skill cap has been raised to 185.

- Paladins and Shadowknights, besides the benefits they gain from the 
two-handed weapons change mentioned above, have also been moved to the 
same combat tables as warriors. In the future we intend to examine the 
existing one-handed weapons useable by knights for possible upgrades. 
We are also increasing the Taunt skill cap for these two classes to 
220.

- Bards have had their 1h blunt and 1h slash skill caps increased to 
250. Their piercing skill cap has been increased to 240. Their Offense 
skill cap has been raised to 252. Bards are also being moved to the 
same combat table with all the other melee and hybrid classes (save 
monks who have separate tables after level 55). Bards Parry skill cap 
has been raised to 185 as well. Finally, the Singing Shortsword can now 
be equipped in the off hand and still give full song enhancing 
benefits.

Please read the detailed explanation of these changes on our 
Developer's Corner message boards at 
http://boards.station.sony.com/ubb/everquest/cgi-bin/Ultimate.cgi

Briefly, the Trivial Loot Code works like this: If a character kills an 
NPC and that NPC does not give them experience, then the Trivial Loot 
Code takes effect. If any member of a group does not get experience for 
a kill, the Trivial Loot Code will take effect. The Trivial Loot Code 
prevents magical, lore and no-drop items from appearing on the corpse. 
Normal items and coins will appear on the corpse in all cases as usual.

** A Tale from Norrath **

Adventurers, glory seekers, and plunder-hungry knaves,

A few new tavern tales have been circulating from across the Deep. It 
appears that strife and civil unrest have once again plagued the lands 
of Kunark. Stories of treachery and terror within the ranks of the 
Sarnak have spilled forth from the mountain fortress of Chardok.

Only a few of the most cunning spies have made their way into the 
Sarnak hive during this brief time of turmoil, and their reports may 
have serious implications. The Brood of Di`zok seems to be more 
organized than before. Their leadership is becoming more structured... 
and much more brutal. Production in the mines appears to be increasing 
and soldiers have been amassing in great numbers.

Other tales have come from this mountain fortress as well. Terror 
squads and interrogators have decimated the ranks of reported Sarnak 
traitors. These squads have been working under the leadership of one of 
the Sarnak Collective's newest council members, Korucust. It can only 
be presumed that this cleansing is another step towards strengthening 
the foul brood.

These tales are hard to confirm, since many of your adventurous kind 
are prone to drink and to the occasional mistruth. If these tales are 
true, it would only stand to reason that new dangers may reveal new 
wealth and glory. Perhaps it is time for you to gather your best gear, 
finish your mug of ale, and head out to investigate.

Good luck adventurers.

** Project M Implemented **

Tonight we have patched something to the PvP servers that many players 
have been waiting for. The ability to play that gnoll, orc, or the cute 
and fuzzy rat. On your character select screen you will notice another 
button in the upper right part of your screen called "Monster". 
Clicking this button will randomly place you in a low-level NPC in a 
random zone. You will be given full control of the creature to do with 
it what you like. You may hunt and kill other creatures. You may even 
attack other players.

Some things to remember when playing your own personal monster (NPC).

-You will not be able to interact with players or NPC's other than 
moving and hitting attack.
-You cannot speak, trade, sell, or do anything else that a player can 
do.
-You will spawn with normal loot for the monster you are playing and 
Player Characters will be able to kill you for loot and experience.
-If you are a spell casting monster you might want to take a moment to 
memorize some spells.
-Once you die, you will return to the character select screen where you 
may choose to return as another NPC or play your normal character.
-You may gain experience, levels, and skills as this NPC, but once you 
die, it is all lost. You will need to start over the next time you 
choose to be a NPC character.
-You can't zone as a monster.
-Monster PCs (MPCs) can not loot, sell, or gain items. They only get 
what they start out with.

This ability to play a monster is being implemented for PvP servers 
only as we have no plans to implement non-consensual PvP on a non PvP 
server.

However, we are still working with this system. We may find other ways 
to implement Project M on the non-PvP servers that are acceptable. We 
aren't done looking at the possible uses of this new feature.

** PvP Server Related **

- Guards, when seeing PCs in combat, will now attack the one that they 
like the least (the one with the lowest appropriate faction). If all 
the PCs involved are highly regarded (have very high faction) the 
guards will allow them to resolve their own issues without interfering.

- Guards should also refrain from attacking PCs that are attacked by 
pets of any sort.

- Sullon Zek now has an across the board experience bonus of 20%, and 
the experience loss on all deaths on Sullon Zek is now 50% less.

** Zone Specific Changes **

- Kael now has specific bind locations, located only at the entryways. 
This means that binding will only be possible in those areas.

- Anti-bottom feeding code has been removed from the Stonebrunt 
Mountains and the Warrens.

- Added a melee bind location to the dock in Iceclad.

** Bug Fixes **

- Fixed a bug that allowed corpses to exist inside walls. Now if a 
corpse ends up in a location that is not 'valid' the corpse will be 
moved to the 'safe coordinates' of the zone. Also, the /corpse command 
will now summon your own corpse to you anywhere in the zone as long as 
that corpse is on the safe spot of the zone. This should prevent 
corpses from being stuck in walls.

- Fixed it so that Critical Hit damage messages match the actual damage done.

- The visible damage bonus modifier on two-handed weapons has been 
corrected. The value that was displayed was incorrect, no change has 
been made to the damage bonus itself.

** Item Changes **

- Fixed an issue with the Bardic Epic weapon. Now if the bard has his 
Epic and an instrument that gives bonuses to songs, the best effect 
will take precedence, rather than the Epic bonuses always being used.

- Cloak of Imperception should now have charges. You will need to 
exchange your old one for a new one with your GM within the next five 
days.

- Donal's Chestplate of Mourning has unlimited charges again.

** Gameplay/Interface Changes/Additions **

- We have changed the way the /consider command works. We have added a 
'light blue' area between green and blue. NPCs that used to /consider 
green but gave experience will now /consider light blue, as well as 
NPCs of slightly lower level than those greens. You will always get 
experience for something that is light blue. You will not receive 
experience for greens. At the same time, by including lower level NPCs 
in the light blue /consider, we have increased the range of lower level 
NPCs that will grant experience. This will be most noticeable for 
characters of higher level.

- Added /targetgroupbuff. Type /targetgroupbuff on to activate, off to 
turn it off. When on, all group buff spells you cast will require a 
target but will affect everyone grouped (and in range) with that 
target, even if it is not your own group. When it is off your group 
buff spells will act normally. This will only work with group buffs 
that have a duration, and will not affect heals, portals or change form 
spells.

- Added code that will put one item onto your cursor if it won't fit 
into your inventory due to a cancelled trade or looting items (and 
other cases). This will only work if there is not already an item on 
the cursor.

- Added code that prevents player characters from dropping coins on the 
ground. This should prevent the loss of coins due to accident or scam.

- Made a modification to the chase camera mouselook code. Moving the 
mouse forward or back in this camera view will make the camera move up 
and down, and the camera also automatically pitches to keep your 
character in view.

- You now see the number of hit points you are healed, and you also now 
see how many hit points you heal when healing others.

** Skill Changes **

- Bard Piercing cap was raised to 250 at 60th level.

- Foraging and Fishing will now result in a wider variety of items, 
especially in zones that have unusual items available to forage or fish 
(such as quest items). Quest and unique items were too common in zones 
that had them, often making it hard to use those skills to obtain items 
such as food and drink. These quest and rare items will now actually be 
rarely foraged or fished, as they should have been. Such items will 
still be available, even to those with low foraging skills, but they 
will be more easily found by those who have practiced the skills.

** Follow-up Patch **

We had a couple of bugs pop up in yesterday's patch. Rather than having 
everyone wait to see them fixed we've elected to roll them in now:

Bards lost the ability to use item effects while moving. This has been 
fixed.

Monks can now train mend again.

Fixed a collision problem that caused people to fall through some 
walls.

Fixed a problem with /targetgroupbuff that allowed people to cast 
combat portal spells on others. 

We apologize for the inconvenience.

** Server Outage for Shadows of Luclin Launch **

In order to update our server for the launch of EverQuest: Shadows of 
Luclin, all servers will be taken down starting at noon on Monday, 
December 3rd. They will be brought back up again on Tuesday, December 
4th at 8 am (Pacific Time - which is -8:00 GMT).

We regret the down time that setting up the new expansion requires. 
Shadows of Luclin offers some exciting new content as well as a 
fantastic new graphics engine. We hope that you'll agree with us that 
Shadows of Luclin is well worth the extended patch time.

Thanks for your patience.

** DirectX 8.0 or higher Required for EverQuest **

When we update the servers on December 3rd for Shadows of Luclin, we 
will also be updating a lot of the code for the existing game. This 
code is written specifically for use with DirectX 8.0 and higher, and 
should provide better performance to most of our customers. The 
improvement will be most noticeable for people using newer hardware.

This will require that all EverQuest players update their DirectX to 
version 8.0 or better to play EverQuest. We will be providing an 
instructional page to help people with this upgrade in the very near 
future at www.everquestlive.com. If you want to test your DirectX 8 
configuration and drivers sooner rather than later, you can do so by 
running "TestEverQuest.exe" in your EverQuest directory and logging on 
to the Test Server. Please view the patch message there for information 
should you have any problems logging in.

*EQClient INI Setting*

There's some confusion about the information that's been released on 
the Test server over the past couple of days, and that confusion is 
resulting in some people having trouble playing EverQuest. To clear it 
up:

The GraphicsDLL setting in your EQClient.ini file should read 
"GraphicsDLL=EQGfx_Dx7.dll" regardless of what server you are playing 
on or what version of DirectX you are running. If you are having 
problems getting in to EverQuest, specifically, problems crashing prior 
to reaching character select, please check and set this entry in your 
EQClient.ini as necessary.

Also, as a reminder, all EverQuest subscribers will need to have 
DirectX 8.1 or better installed on their system in order to play 
beginning Tuesday morning. The latest version of DirectX can be found 
at http://www.microsoft.com/directx.

*** Welcome to Luclin *** 

"As you know, youngster, we of the League of Antonican Bards have made 
it our primary goal to travel to places before others. It is our duty 
to see what hasn't yet been seen and to make song of it when we return. 
We carry news, song and spirit to all of Norrath. We have also taken it 
upon ourselves to carry personal news in the form of letters wherever 
possible. And that's what I've called you here to talk about. 

... 

No, I am not assigning you the duty of establishing a mail route into 
Grobb. We've lost far too many young bards trying to do that. 
Recruitment of smart young lads and lasses is nearly impossible when 
they all think that we plan to send them out to become bard fillet. 
We've only been able to recruit youngsters that no other guild wanted 
because they were so... 

... 

No, of course I don't mean you. 

Now stop interrupting. 

I have a job for you. You know, don't you, that Al'Kabor has once again 
been clomping about using his powerful magics without much regard for 
consequences, don't you? 

... 

/em sighs. 

Ok, your FIRST task is to read up on current events! () 

Your second task is to find out if the rumors about his recent 
experiments are true. They say (and "they" are pretty reliable) that 
things such as noble-looking Kerrans calling themselves the Vah Shir, 
strange beasts of burden and new spells and songs have started showing 
up on Antonica. They also say that this is all due to the experiments 
of that Erudite Wizard Al'Kabor. You are to head out to one of the 
great wizard spires and investigate. If you can, interview one of these 
cat people and bring us back one of these horses they talk about... 

... 

Maybe you should talk to my assistant about things like directions out 
of the city and where you can find some shoes more appropriate for 
travel." 

All this you overhear as you wait outside for your turn to talk to the 
loremasters of the League of Antonican Bards. 

The door opens and you see a dejected and confused looking young bard 
step out. Following him out the door you hear a bellow, 

"I also expect you to let everyone know that we are NO LONGER trying to 
establish mail routes to Grobb! Trolls can't read very well anyway." 

Shadows of Luclin opens up new adventures and new challenges, as well 
as new rewards for those with a spirit of adventure. 

Are you up to the challenge? 

*** Notes for Shadows of Luclin customers *** 

IMPORTANT: do not lose your Shadows of Luclin CDs. Because of the 
immense amount of data on the three Shadows of Luclin CDs, you will not 
be able to just copy the executable file into a new directory and 
download the rest of the expansion. We have placed restrictions on the 
amount of data that customers can download from our patcher so that 
massive patching as a replacement for reinstalling from the disk will 
not impact our other customers. So if you have a hard drive problem or 
you wish to install EverQuest on a new computer, you will need to have 
your CD to do so. 

TECH SUPPORT: Please visit our Tech Support Center at if you have any 
problems with your Luclin installation. 

/facepick - this new command will allow those of you with Shadows of 
Luclin to change your characters face. It will only work for characters 
using the new models. If you've turned off Gnomes and your character is 
a Gnome, you will not be able to use this command on that character. 
And it will, obviously, only work for those with Shadows of Luclin 
installed. 

/dismount - This command allows your character to dismount from a horse 
if for some reason he has lost the ability to do so using the bridle. 
There is no /mount command, only the bridle will allow you to mount a 
horse. 

*** Other Changes with this Patch *** 

Along with our preparations for the introduction of Shadows of Luclin, 
we have made a few other changes with this patch: 

** Gameplay Changes ** 

- Increased the amount of mana given by high Intelligence and Wisdom 
scores, as well as that granted by items and spells. 

- Fixed a bug that was causing rogues to critical with every use of a 
thrown weapon. 

- Fixed a bug that caused the experience bar to displaying incorrectly 
after leveling. This also seemed to cause a crash in certain cases when 
in F10 view. 

** PvP Changes ** 

- PVP looting will now display to the group. 

- Empty corpses will no longer disappear when looted by an enemy 
player, they will decay at the normal rate for empty corpses. 

- Guards in 'guard zones', such as cities, will continue to protect 
characters that they find the least offensive (the one with the highest 
faction). But guards in outdoor zones will be less likely to join in a 
fight. They will only come to the aid of people that they like. 
Otherwise they will not get involved in PvP combat. 

- Etched Peridot of Nature will be removed from all locations, 
including those held by players on their characters or in their banks. 
This item was not intended to be available until Shadows of Luclin went 
live, and then only in Luclin zones. 

** Spell Changes ** 

- Spells that heal less than 10 points of damage will not generate a 
message to the player. 

- Velious portal teeth (Great Divide, Wakening Lands and Cobalt Scar) 
are no longer required to teleport to those locations. These items are 
also no longer soul bound. 

- Fixed a bug with the Bard Song of Occlusion 

** New Commands ** 

- /stand now implemented. We've added this command because not everyone 
speaks programmer and would think that the logical reverse of /sit 
would be /sit off. :) 

- /particledensity command - Switches particle density on the fly 
without having to click it in the menus and exit the game. 

** Some new things you'll see ** 

- We now have the ability to flag an NPC as non-targetable. This in 
effect renders the NPC non-attackable as well. Clicking on one of these 
NPCs will cause your current target selection to clear. This 
functionality is used primarily for the presentation of content. For 
instance, if we want an NPC to spawn and tell you a story, he can tell 
his story without being attacked mid-sentance by other players. It also 
opens up some pretty interesting content avenues. As an example, we can 
make NPCs unharmable until you do a quest "stripping them of their 
power". 

- There are several new item classes (types) in the world. For example, 
there are weapons that do enhanced damage versus certain races (e.g. 
Perhaps you'll find a +2 vs froglok sword, or a +4 vs Bear club. In 
addition we can do the same type of thing with types of creatures (+3 
vs humanoid, +1 vs Undaed). We've also added elemental modifiers (e.g. 
a +4 Fire sword). The bonus value is calculated as and increased DMG 
stat on the weapon, except that the elemental portion is run through 
the resistance system before calculating the strength of your hit. 
There are some items out there with bonuses to some more interesting 
stats, but we'll leave it to you to figure them out :) 

- There's a lot more out there. Be prepared to reevaluate your 
assumptions and redefine the way you approach the world. Proposed 
solutions to situations and quests that you might have previously 
written off saying, "They can't do that in EverQuest", might be exactly 
the way you need to approach the problem at hand. As fellow gamers, we 
envy you as you approach Luclin and find everything fresh, new, and 
waiting to be solved. And to those of you who aren't first to solve the 
quests or adventure in the new areas, we urge you to do so with your 
friends, and leave the spoiler sites out of it. Good luck on your 
journies. 

** Note on New Features ** 

EverQuest: The Shadows of Luclin contains many new features which have 
yet to stand up to the scrutiny of 400,000 experienced players. Without 
doubt there will be some situations where we need to reevaluate the 
gameplay-impact of some of those features and adjust them accordingly 
to maintain game integrity. As an example, we think that they might 
accelerate and decelerate too quickly, but will have to wait until we 
see them used by a broad spectrum of players before we can make a final 
determination. We thank you for your patience in these matters. 

** Note on Impending Features **

As we approached our launch date we found that several features which 
are planned are also not yet ready for prime-time. We're currently 
working on the following items, many of which will be implemented in 
the very near future: 

- Extra flora in outdoor zones. Sprigs of grass, small bushes, flowers, 
etc. 

- A robuste merchantile system in the bazaar that lets you flag 
yourself as a merchant, set prices, and conduct business without having 
to conduct business manually with each buyer and seller. 

- We will be polishing up issues regarding tinted items in game. In 
other words, things that shouldn't tint with a tinted item (e.g. your 
skin) won't tint when the feature is complete. 

- Light beards on high elves, dark elves, half elves, and dwarf females 
will be tintable along with the hair color. We are going to leave in 
the ability for you to change your appearance until after we've added 
more customization options. 

We thank you for your patience and patronage as we implement these 
features. Good luck with your adventures on Luclin!

*Fixed Bugs*

- Fixed a bug that was preventing characters from being bald (those 
that were allowed to).
- Halved the speed of the new Skeleton walk and run animations because 
they were playing about twice as fast as they should have been.
- Fixed a bug that was causing all of the facial features (hair, beard, 
etc...) to switch back to default in certain cases when you switched 
from one face to another (faces with special eyes, like the faces with 
eye patches and white eye).
- Fixed a crash bug with /follow. 
- Found and Fixed the crash bug with soldungb and everfrost and other 
places.
- Fixed transparency code with i810 display adapters
- Fixed a problem introduced into the sound engine that causes 
framerate problems and sound stutter in some places.
- Fixed a crash bug that had to do with dying from your familiar 
effect.
- Research the group buff bug and fixed it.
- Fixed a crash bug with root and gate.
- Various item and content fixes.

*Hot Items* (The items we're considering top priority)

- Bard issues: We're working to correct the problems bards have been 
experiencing with their songs.
- K6 Processors: We're working to fix, or provide a work-around for 
problems AMD K6 users are experiencing when entering some zones. 
- Armor layer tinting (e.g. tinting your armor without tinting your 
skin)

We are reviewing the issues sent to us as they are sent in and will be 
doing daily patches as necessary to get everything working to your and 
our satisfaction as quickly as possible. Please remember that EverQuest 
users need to have DirectX 8.1 and the appropriate drivers for their 
video card. Visit our tech support center first if you are having 
issues:

December 7, 2001  3:00 am

*Fixes*

- Shaved 10 seconds of zoning for every subscriber.
- Made it so familiars don't get agroed on.
- Fixed several zone crash bugs
- Changed a paladin spell - a design error in the spell trivialized 
several aspects of the high-end game.
- Fixed several item and content problems.
- Fixed several faction issues - some faction information released with 
Luclin deviated from norm.

December 10, 2001  3:00 am
------------------------------

*Patch Changes*

- Fixed a problem that resulted in excessive swapping for people with 
particles turned off.

- Fear spells should again be working correctly.

- AoE fear spells will no longer work versus players on PvP Servers.

- Fixed a crash caused by a familiar dying.

- Fixed a bug with the "Alternate Advancement" system. An artifact from 
the removal of the class-based experience penalty several months ago 
resulted in hybrids gaining AAXP much faster than they should, and 
warriors and rogues gaining it slower. AA-point cost was designed to be 
the same regardless of class.

- Increased the experience cost per AA-point overall after analysis of 
point accruals accross the game. 

- Corrected several zone-crashes. Also implemented a workaround to 
prevent the Hollowshade crash while we investigate the problem further.

- Fixed several miscellaneous bugs that were causing crashes or had the 
potential to cause crashes on varied systems. 

- Fixed a bug that caused some people to crash when reentering the game 
after exiting.

- Addressed a good number of content-related issues (quest problems, 
bad items, etc).

*Luclin Install*

- We found that the default install directory for Luclin may be wrong 
for some people, specifically those who have copied their EverQuest 
files into a directory different from their initial installation. 

- Also, we've received a number of calls from Luclin subscribers who've 
tried logging in to their character on a friends computer that does not 
have an install of Luclin on it. This will not work as the files 
necessary for you to view Luclin content are not present unless Luclin 
has been installed. 

- We've added code to point out both of these cases in the future.

*Continued Plans*

- As we wrap up the technology-related issues over the course of this 
week, making sure that everyone who wants to play EverQuest can play 
EverQuest, the programming team will shift their focus to aesthetic 
issues such as animation speed/timing, armor tinting, face-picker 
operation, etc. We do indeed plan on getting to all of these issues in 
the very short term.

- The content-team, however, is hard at work on content-related issues 
right now, and stands ready to address any broken quests, items, 
encounter-imbalances, etc., that you may run across in your adventures. 
Please feel free to visit our forums off of www.everquestlive.com and 
submit a comment through the Developer's Corner.

*Patch Changes*

- Fixed a memory leak that was causing excessive swapping when moving 
between outdoor Luclin zones.
- Implemented some changes to zoning that should improve times, 
especially for modem users.
- Fixed several potential crash bugs.
- You can now only have 100 unused points in your alternate advancement 
pool.
- Fixed the bug that prevented non-Luclin subscribers from seeing the 
Vah Shir model.
- Addressed many content-related problems. We appreciate the reports 
we've received. 
- Continued optimizations of the 3D engine.

December 12, 2001  12:00 am
------------------------------

* Patch Changes *

- Several changes to hair functionality: Expanded beard color choices 
for Erudite males, pushed back the camera a bit for human males when 
making hair selections (so they can see themselves) and fixed it so 
that the camera will no longer rotate around Erudites while in hair 
selection mode of character creation. Also fixed a bug with the left 
selection arrow sometimes not changing hair color.
- Fixed the "Entering Luclin" message bug. This was only an errant text 
message, it was not causing any crashes or keeping anyone out of the 
game.
- Fixed a bug where Vah Shir with an intelligence over a certain amount 
could not be created.
- Fixed a bug with faction-affecting items: They were giving a bonus to 
all factions instead of just the intended faction
- Fixed a problem with arrows and quivers that would result in the 
person being logged out.
- Adjusted the cost of Combine Platemail to be inline with its stats 
and other armor available within game.
- Made several gameplay changes to The Grey. A single group having the 
ability to simultaneously engage and prevail against 35+ experience-
giving creatures is not in line with the desire for risk vs. reward and 
the promotion of balanced groups.
- Removed some bad NPCs in Chardok.
- Tuned encounters in The Fungus Grove, Maiden's Eye, and Dawnshroud 
Peaks.
- Clarified some quest dialog in Sanctus Seru.
- Tuned The Deep, also improved the variety of drops.
- Improved pathing in The Temple of Ssraeshza
- Improved pathing in Sanctus Seru
- Improved pathing in Echo Caverns
- Added some newbie beastlord quests in the old world.
- Removed the "Lore" tag from the "Darkened Knight's Bracer"

** Texture Cache **

In an effort to improve loading and zoning times, we've added the 
ability to cache textures to your hard drive. One of the things that 
your computer is doing when you load up the game or change zones is 
building textures and putting them into RAM on your computer. Each time 
you log in or zone the game has to create the textures you need and put 
them into RAM for use during gameplay.

This, obviously, takes a little time.

We have added an option that allows you to save that information to 
your hard drive rather than creating it each time you log in or zone.

This does have a few drawbacks. It will require a lot of hard drive 
space to store these textures. In the most extreme case it could use up 
as much as 1.5 GB of hard drive space, though this would be the 
extreme. It could, however, easily use 500 MB of space on your hard 
drive. And because writing all this data to your hard drive takes a 
little time, the first time you use this feature it will take a bit 
longer to log in.

The game will never allow you to fall below 500 MB of space on your 
hard drive when creating the texture cache. This is to prevent any 
problems with a shortage of space on your hard drive. But it also means 
that you will need to have plenty of hard drive space free to use this 
option; 500 MB plus the amount needed for the texture cache.

Also, if you change any of your setting for graphics {like changing the 
texture quality) it will have to rewrite these files, meaning that your 
first log in after making such a change will take longer than usual as 
it writes these files to your hard drive.

The benefits is that once you have allocated the hard drive space and 
logged in to create the needed files, the game can then read that 
information directly into RAM from your hard drive rather than creating 
them each time you log in or zone.

What this feature does not allow you to do is to increase the settings 
above those that are recommended. If the game suggests that you only 
use ten models, turning on the Texture Cache will not make it a good 
idea to turn on more models. This feature will not change that. Those 
recommendations are based on the amount of RAM you have available and 
your video card. The hard drive cache does not effectively add RAM to 
your machine, it just allows the game to save time creating the 
textures that your existing RAM and video card use.

There are two ways to activate this feature. You can check the 'Texture 
Cache' box in the Options screen, or you can turn it on from within the 
eqclient.ini file. To activate it, add the following line to the 
eqclient.ini file:

TextureCache=TRUE

This could improve load times dramatically depending on your settings. 
The more models and graphics features you have turned on, the greater 
the potential decrease in loading times you will see using the Texture 
Cache.

Remember: This will require a lot of hard drive space, so be certain 
that you have a lot of free hard drive space if you turn this option 
on. The more stuff you enable (models, texture quality, etc.) the more 
space you will need.

We expect this to be of greatest benefit to folks with 256 megs of RAM 
and a lot of hard drive space. The more RAM your system has, the less 
benefit you should expect to see by using the texture cache.

also been added.

To obtain the text files which enable a language, go to the Advanced 
Options screen in the patcher and click on the appropriate language box 
before clicking on "Download".

* Soulbinders *

A new group has appeared in Norrath (and on Luclin as well). Rumor has 
it that these 'Soulbinders' have dedicated themselves to research on 
the power and essence of our inner being. Some call them fanatics, as 
they claim that knowledge of the spirit that dwells within will lead 
them to an understanding of the whole of existence. Citizens often 
treat them with the same respect and distance that they treat the 
Priests of Discord. However, these Soulbinders have dedicated 
themselves to public service, and for them that service falls along 
their lines of specialty...

The next time you find yourself far away from home, you might seek the 
services of a Soulbinder.

/ooc: We've added these "Soulbinder" NPCs to all cities that player 
characters can start in, as well as Firiona Vie, The Overthere, 
Shadowhaven and Iceclad at the request of players. It is our hope that 
these new NPCs will help players by reducing the time it takes to find 
a bind from another player character.
