** Welcome to Dragons of Norrath! ** 

A series of events has transpired across the world of Norrath and the 
familiar faces of Firiona Vie and her nemesis Lanys T'Vyl return to 
find themselves at the forefront of the events. Unbeknownst to them, a 
dark influence has seeped into the world of Norrath causing new 
tensions to arise and conflicts to intensify as the dawn of a new age 
emerges. The Age of War is upon the people of Norrath and heroes return 
in this ultimate, unending battle between good and evil. 

Prepare for EverQuest: Dragons of Norrath and return to the lands 
between Halas and Lavastorm as you seek out the Nest, the ancestral 
birthplace of all dragons, long sealed away and hidden from the eyes of 
Norrath. But beware, if the Nest is exposed too early during the Brood 
Dawn, all dragons and their eggs will be cursed for eternity and death 
will storm down on all Norrathian's not in their service. 

Featuring new lands with enhanced graphics, bold new storylines, and 
updated creatures including goblins, drakes, dragons and the ominous 
Frost Giant! EverQuest: Dragons of Norrath is the next great expansion 
pack for the fantasy saga that is EverQuest. Make ready with new 
features such as the interactive world map, use your potion belt to 
access magical items quickly, and swap between weapon sets using the 
bandolier. Plus, with the all new guild hall you can easily get your 
guild ready to encounter anything that comes your way! EverQuest: 
Dragons of Norrath is bursting with new adventures and intense battles 
for players of all levels. 


** Features ** 

* Bandolier * 

To open the Bandolier window use the 'B' key. 

The bandolier will provide you with a quick and easy way to wield your 
weapons in different predefined combinations. When a weapon set is 
activated, the bandolier switches the currently equipped weapons with 
as many of the weapon set items it can find in your inventory. To add a 
bandolier, first click on the slot that you want to fill. Then click 
the add button. You can name each set. The weapon set that will be 
saved as the weapons you currently have in your inventory (primary, 
secondary, range, and ammo slots). You can make hotbuttons out of the 
weapon sets for easy, quick swapping. 

* Potion Belt * 

To open the potion belt window use 'shift P'. 

The Potion Belt allows for quick use of inventory items, such as 
potions or magical devices. To add a potion belt enabled item to the 
potion belt, simply put the item on your cursor and click in one of the 
belt slots. Then simply right click on the item to use it. Please note 
that not all clickable items are usable from the potion belt. 

* The Barter Zone * 

The entrance to the Barter Zone is in the western section of the Plane 
of Knowledge. The default in-game map has the location marked on it 
(this may not be true if have a custom map). To setup your character as 
buyer, use the /buyer command to bring up the Buyer Barter Window. When 
you'd like to sell an item quickly without heading to the bazaar, use 
the /barter command to bring up the Barter Window. Please refer to the 
context tips or the manual for more information. 

* The Guild Lobby and the Guild Hall* 

The entrance to the Guild lobby is also in the western section of the 
Plane of Knowledge. The Guild Hall entrance is at the back of the Guild 
lobby accessible by active guild members. 

Guild Lobby: 

- Looking for Guild and Looking for Guild Member tool: You can use the 
looking for guild tool or the looking for a guild member tool by 
clicking on the note boards. In the Guild Lobby use your map to find 
the note boards. 

- Corpse Summoning: Speak to a Disciple of Luclin. This Disciple can 
sell you a level appropriate soulstone. Take the soulstone to a nearby 
Priest or Priestess and they'll summon all of your existing corpses in 
Norrath directly to your feet (except those corpses that are in 
Shadowrest). Be sure you loot your corpses quickly because they won't 
be there long! 

Guild Hall: 

- Guild Portal: The guild portal is activated by speaking to the gnome 
in the Guild Hall. You will need to purchase a focus stone from him and 
then hand it back in order to focus the portal on a specific location. 
Once the portal is focused, step on the crystal platform to bring up a 
yes/no dialog box. Clicking yes should teleport you away. 

- Mana/Health regen pool: Walking into the back right room in the Guild 
Hall will cause you to regenerate health, mana, and endurance at twice 
your normal rate. You should see a text message when you enter the area 
of the pool as well as a particle effect on your character. 

- Buff Timers: Buff timers are paused while in the Guild Hall. 

- Guild Tradeskill Objects: Various tradeskill tools are located in the 
Guild Hall for easy access by guild members. 

* Missions * 

Mission givers for Dark Reign and Norrath's Keepers can now be found in 
Lavastorm. These mission givers offer quests for groups of 3 to 6 
players that take you into the Dragons of Norrath. Only a few missions 
are available at first, but as you gain faction and earn their trust, 
more missions will open up. Missions make use of a new shared task 
system that shares space with the Task window (Alt-Q). You can manage 
the players in your shared task from the new Shared Task tab in the 
Task window. 

Successful completion of a mission will reward you with crystals that 
can be redeemed at mission vendors in the two camps. Each side has 
their own crystals that they award and their mission vendors will not 
accept crystals from the opposing side. You can create stacks of 
crystals for trading to other players by clicking on the crystals 
display in the inventory window. The reclaim tab under the crystals 
display will add any crystals you have in your inventory. You can only 
spend crystals that are listed in the display, so be sure to reclaim 
before visiting a vendor. 

** Live Patch Information ** 

The EQ Mail System! 

EQ players now have the ability to send persistent messages to players 
who are not logged in! To use this new feature, take a look at the new 
icon that has been added to the window selector. This icon will change 
color when you have unread messages. It also blinks for a short period 
of time when new mail arrives. To open the mail window, click on the 
icon or use CTRL-M. Here are a few other helpful hints. 

Sending Messages - To send a message, press the "Compose" button. Enter 
the character name of the recipient in the "To" field, a subject and 
the message itself. Press the "Send" button and mail icon of the 
recipient will start blinking! Please be aware that you can currently 
only email one recipient at a time. 

Receiving Messages- If you are online, new mail is delivered to you 
immediately without delay. When you open the mail window, the number of 
unread messages is put between square brackets close to the "Inbox" 
list title. In the mail window, your messages usually appear sorted by 
date. You can click on the column header to change the sort type and 
order. You can also resize the width of a column with the mouse, just 
click and drag a column header separator. 

Viewing Messages - To view the body of a message, select it in the 
list. The message text window displays the message fields in a 
different color, followed by the text of the message. 

Managing Messages- When a message is selected you can reply to the 
sender or forward the message to another player by pressing the 
corresponding button. An appropriate default subject will be inserted 
for you and a copy of the original message is added to the mail 
composition window. 

Deleting Messages - You can also delete messages, in which case they 
will be placed in your "Deleted Items" folder. To select multiple 
messages for deletion you can use SHIFT-click and CTRL-click. The 
"Deleted Items" list is where your deleted messages go. The total 
number of messages in that list appears in the title. Two additional 
actions are available to you when managing your deleted messages: you 
can restore deleted messages using the "Undelete" button, and you can 
permanently delete all the messages by click on the "Empty Trash" 
button. 

NOTE: You can send a message to yourself. You can also send a message 
from the command line using the "[mailto" command. Syntax: [mailto If 
the subject contains whitespace, you must enclose it in double 
quotation marks. Example: [mailto LadyCandy "You are so sweet!" Dear 
LadyCandy, etc. etc.

80 second recast. Reflective skin also now has an 18 second duration. 
This should make the mask easier to use when used correctly. 

- Fixed a bug with the Zun Muram in Txevu. Previously he was not 
dropping his signet for the alternative access to Tacvi 100% of the 
time, due to a bug. This has now been corrected.

*** Bazaar & Barter Zone *** 
--------------------------------- 

We have made the Bazaar zone free for everyone. 

In addition to this, we have consolidated the Barter zone and the Bazaar 
zone into one hybrid zone, which uses the existing Bazaar zone. You will 
now be able to activate both the /buyer commands and the /trader commands 
in the Bazaar zone. In addition to this change, we have made a few other 
changes for your convenience. 

- Removed the zone line from the Bazaar to the Barter zone. 
- Added a zone-line from the Bazaar to the Plane of Knowledge. 
- The Barter zone entrance in the Plane of Knowledge will now teleport 
you to the Bazaar zone. 
- Barter search on Firiona should not filter the NODROP items that aren't 
NODROP on Firiona. 
- Right-clicking on a merchant-name in the UI will now create a find-path 
to the merchant. 
- Right-click in the Bazaar / Barter search now closes your current find 
path, and if the timer has expired, generates a new find path to the 
Buyer / Trader indicated on the line which was right-clicked. 
- The map has been updated with more information, specifically which areas 
of the zone allow you to be a /buyer and which allow you to be a /trader. 

The Barter zone is still active, so those of you who are camped out in the 
zone will be able to log in just fine, though you will want to migrate to 
the Bazaar in order to set up your buyer. Please make sure that you are not 
weighed down with coin and items before leaving the zone, or you may find 
yourself unable to move. 

*** Spell & Skill Changes *** 
---------------------------------

the Panther to avoid a stacking conflict with the berserker epic effect.

3 to 10, and increased the mana cost on the spells that summon them. 
- Summoned Lava Orbs, Molten Orbs, Shadow Orbs, and Soul Orbs are now no drop 
on the Firiona Vie server. 
- The recourse effect of the shadow knight epic 1.5 and 2.0 effects should now go

*** Quests, Missions & Events ***

legacy Sullon Zek insignias. 
- Decreased difficulty of the Megalodon encounter in Lake Rathe. 
- NPCs will now offer you missions based on your average group level rather than 
the level of the player requesting the mission. 
- Added a fix for the problem of a player in the process of zoning when the 
mission is completed not being given the reward; when finished zoning he will 
then receive the reward. 
- We've changed the way that corpse lock works when an NPC is killed by someone 
in a shared task. You should no longer see corpses locked to a shared task when 
you are killing NPCs not related to a shared task. 

*** Tradeskills *** 
--------------------------------- 
- The trivial values of many tradeskill recipes have been modified, please make 
sure to check your recipe lists. 
- The Dragons of Norrath Tradeskill Quest NPC's will now accurately recognize 
your ability to wear the armor they're helping you craft. 

*** Email *** 
--------------------------------- 
- We will now be using the mail system to send players notifications. The first 
use of this is with the messages you get when you reach certain levels.

*** Miscellaneous *** 
--------------------------------- 
- Guild masters will once again allow to you get started with your training in 
Research, Alchemy, Poison Making, and Tinkering.

- The Bandolier and Potion Belt window shortcuts/binding will now save properly. 
- The map window will properly tint the map area again on the map tab. 
- We've made significant changes to the fog and rain settings in all original 
EverQuest zones. Visibility should be greatly improved in many of these zones 
and rain will generally be more infrequent. Seasonal changes from rain to snow 
have also been incorporated into these zones as appropriate. In addition, we've 
increased the visibility in all zones when it is raining or snowing. 
- Added a new command, /tasktimers, which will display a list of shared tasks 
and how long you must wait before you can undertake that shared task again. This 
will be incorporated into the task window in the near future but we wanted to make 
the functionality available to players as soon as possible. 
- Fixed the bug where players would appear with someone else's pet after zoning. 
- Fixed an issue where a Link Dead player is killed, the killer will no longer be 
able to loot an item. 
- Zek players will now be able to begin the process of selecting a new server to 
have all characters on their account moved to. 

Those Zek players who have already executed the /movelog command will be moved to 
the server they chose, unless that server was Solusek Ro or Kane Bayle. Zek players 
who chose either of these servers will need to execute the command again, choosing 
a new server. 

If you have changed your mind as to which server you would like to move to, the 
/movelog UI (after Thursdays update) will have a disregard button. Using the 
disregard button will cancel any pending movelog requests and allow you to execute 
a new movelog request. 

We will begin processing the movelog requests on Friday night (March 4th) and 
will continue nightly for a period of 30 days. Any accounts that have executed 
the movelog request will need to make certain they have no corpses in the world. 
If you have a shared bank already in use on your destination server, you will need 
to empty either shared bank out as only one will be available after the movelog 
is complete.

EverQuest's 6th Anniversary 
-------------------------------------- 
To help celebrate the 6th Anniversary of EverQuest, a fresh scavenger hunt has been

this challenging hunt and you will receive a potion that doubles your experience for 
30 minutes and comes with 10 charges. 

Your old friends, the Fabled NPCs have returned to Norrath and bring the fabled versions 
of their items with them. Look for new Fabled NPCs in your favorite Kunark zones.

Dwarves, High Elves and Gnomes have been altered slightly to make them a bit friendlier 
to complete. 
- The encounter with Grinbik in Bloodfields for the Ranger epic has been made a bit 
less confusing. 
- "A shady Highpass citizen" in Highpass will look kindly on you and spread the word 
on your increased friendship if you complete his tasks.

March 17, 2005 
------------------------------

*** Missions ***
---------------------------------- 

- Added the ability to see invisible to some of the NPCs in The Nest instances. 
- Set some of the boss NPCs in Dragons of Norrath missions to summon. Being kited 
was making them sad. 
- Removed a bug in the Rivals mission in The Nest that allowed groups to complete 
the mission more than once without speaking to the quest-giver again. 

*** Tradeskills ***
----------------------------------
- Added some missing Troll cultural items to vendors in Neriak. 
- Added a book to outline the creation of the new cultural sewing kits. 
- All of the new cultural sewing kits can now be traded in to Caerlyna in the Bazaar 
for tokens. 
- Meeka Diggs in Rivervale no longer sells Iron Thread and should now sell the three 
sizes of Mercurium Thread. 
- Changed the text on Culturally Inspired Armor - part 3 to accurately reflect the 
pelts used for Half Elven cultural tailored armors. 
- There was a new "Chunk of Ice" created for the Dragons of Norrath expansion. This 
new "Chunk of Ice" has been removed and replaced with the old "Chunk of Ice" on the 
forage tables for all Dragons of Norrath zones. They should also now drop off some 
of the colder dervishes. All of the new Dragons of Norrath drink recipes that used 
"Chunk of Ice" (Curdled Cream, Iced Coffee, Iced Tea and Iced Mountain Tea) now use 
the old "Chunk of Ice".
- Fixed a bug with the recipe for creating Barbarian cultural leather swatches. The 
recipes were mistakenly using the "Norrathian Needle" instead of the "Northman Needle".
- Fixed a bug in the recipe for creating the Dragons of Norrath cultural armor patterns 
that could allow a player to recover their ruined book with a successful salvage. Sorry, 
that was unintentional. 
- Removed the Erudite Sewing Kit from vendors. The new kit is created by players and 
should replace the old kit. 
- Fixed the Feir'Dal Fletching Kit. Really, we did. 
- Fixed the Surefall Fletching Kit. (This was actually fixed with the last update). 
- Fixed the Reinforced Jeweler's Kit. (This was actually fixed with the last update). 
- Changed the Dragons of Norrath cultural recipes that used "Quill" to now use "A Quill" 
(used in research recipes). "A Quill" is also now sold on the appropriate vendors. (This 
was actually changed with the last update). 

*** Ranger Epic ***
----------------------------------
- Modified the encounter with Grinbik in Bloodfields for the Ranger epic slightly. Previously 
he could respond with the phrase "I wish to speak with the one that freed me." when he was 
not actually free (for example, if the Marshal was still alive). Now he will not give that 
response until he has actually been freed. Hopefully this will remove some confusion from 
the event. 
- A Ranger at the proper stage of the quest will now only trigger the Herrian Warfrost 
encounter if he or she goes down the corridor near where he hangs out and is at the proper 
stage of the quest with the necessary item on them. (This change actually went in with our 
last update). 

*** Fabled Item Changes ***
----------------------------------
- The Fabled Mrylokar's Bracer has been made lore. 
- Several Fabled NPC's have had their difficulty modified.

*** Headlines *** 
------------------------------------ 
- A new button has been added to character select: Return Home. If a character 
has not been played in the past 6 hours, this button is enabled and pressing it 
will log the character into the game in their starting city. 
- If a character is logged out for more than an hour, full health, mana, and endurance 
will be granted upon logging in. This is still a bit under development. You may not be 
quite at 100% but very close. 
- Re-envisioning has begun! 
- Over 600 Spell modifications. 
- New zone art for the character select screen and character creation. Crossing the 
bridge while in Explore mode will allow you to enter the world. Note that all characters 
are in the same area now. There are no longer class specific areas. 
- New Hot Spots!* 
The Warrens 
Netherbian Lair 
Echo Caverns 
The Scarlet Desert 
The Tower of Frozen Shadow 
The Hole 
The Grey 
Howling Stones 
The Halls of Betrayal (Chardok B) 
- There are 2 new keyboard shortcuts in the Command section in the Options menu, Open 
Inventory Bags and Close Inventory Bags. Setting these, then using them will open/close 
all your general inventory slot bags (bag1-bag8). 
- Added a teleportation stone to Arena in Plane of Knowledge.* 


*** Re-envisioning Specifics *** 
------------------------------------ 
- Many modifications have been made to the cast times, recast times, mana costs, and 
damage potential of many single target direct damage spells. The largest changes have 
been in level 1-50 spells, but many 50+ spells have been adjusted as well. These changes 
have caused the damage-per-second potential and/or the damage-per-mana values of these 
spells to be increased and should benefit the classes who use these spells in nearly 
all cases. Note that this also includes special purpose spells such as undead and 
summoned direct damage spells. Please check the in game descriptions for specific 
changes.* 
- The 750 cap on mana increase spells has been removed.* 
- The hard-coded level 52 NPC cap on Fear spells has been removed. We will be adding 
new fear spells in the near future which will allow players to fear higher level NPCs.* 
- Assassin’s Feint will now work on NPCs level 60 and higher.* 
- Spells with poison counters no longer have innate agro added. The spells themselves 
still generate aggro based on their other properities, but you will see a reduction 
in the amount of aggro generated in many cases.* 
- NPC’s innate 20% resistance against rain spells has been removed.* 
- You will now receive messages in your chat window when you are healed by any 
heal-over-time spell. This includes both short term HOT spells as well as long term 
regen spells. You will receive the message if the spell actually gave you health back, 
so will not receive messages when at full health. These messages can be turned off 
through a new filter in the options window.* 
- Ranger, Beastlord, and Paladin heals have been upgraded. See the spell descriptions 
in game for details.* 
- The AC cap and percentage return on AC over the cap for monks has been increased.* 
- Increased the knock back effect on the Warrior AA Press the Attack. 
- Theft of Thought will no longer return only partial mana from NPCs over level 52. 
In addition, the spell was changed so that it will only return as much mana as the NPC 
has if that is less than the amount that the spell is trying to steal. So it will 
steal 400 mana from an NPC that has 1000 mana, but it will only steal 100 mana from 
a NPC that has 100 mana.* 


*** Spells, Skills & AAs *** 
------------------------------------ 
- Increased the effectiveness and decreased the casting time of the Ranger AA 
Auspice of the Hunter.* 
- Increased the amount of damage absorbed by the Bard AA Shield of Notes.* 
- Increased the damage done while using the Bard AA Dance of Blades.* 
- Added a negative resistance mod to the Shaman AA Virulent Paralysis so it is 
more likely to land on NPCs now.* 
- Modified the proc chance on spell Lightning Channeling and Storm Channeling. 
Both of these spells now have an increased proc chance. 
- Sound of Divinity and Sound of Might will now use their own separate shared spell 
timer. 
- The spell enhanced learning can no longer have its duration increased by Alternate 
advancement skills and/or focus effects. 
- Flames of the Valiant and Flames of Redemption should now proc more often and be 
resisted much less often. 
- Protection of the Wild should no longer be overwritten by Strength of the Hunter.* 
- Spirit of the Panther and Spirit of the Leopard have been modified. NPCs were 
able to trigger the effects of these spells at a much higher rate then players. 
The rate of NPCs triggering these effects has been lowered to match PCs. Additionally, 
the base damage of the effect has been lowered, and the spell will now only land on 
PCs and pets that are a part of your group. 
- Removed the focus effect limiters from Persuasive Gaze, the focus effect found on 
the enchanter epic 1.5. It now works on any detrimental spells up to level 70 the 
same way the focus effect on the enchanter epic 2.0 does.* 
- Fixed a problem with focus effects that reduce hate. It was not using the highest 
effect if more than one focus effect was worn. 
- Dragon Fang and Leopard Claw will now generate less hate. 


*** Items *** 
------------------------------------ 
- Items that have a combat or clickable spell effect that was changed due to the spell 
changes in this patch have either had their proc rate adjusted to compensate or use a 
new spell to maintain their damage potential. 
- The Anguish chest pieces now have additional worn mods and a new spell focus effect. 
- The Anguish wrist pieces now have additional worn mods. 
- Mirrored Mask will no longer conflict with other recast timer based items such as the 
Soul Orb. 
- Hammer of Rancorous Thoughts is now a 39/25 weapon with a 225pt proc. 
- Dragonkiller is now a 34 (+2 magic)/21 weapon. 
- Mace of Grim Tidings is a 32/22 weapon. 
- Broken Mandible of the Broodqueen is now a 12/18 weapon and has a +5% mod to backstab. 
- Fang of Kessdona now has +12% mod to backstab. 
- Crescent Palemoon now has the focus Aneuk Glare. It also has +15 avoid, +4 spell 
rune and +4 regen.

- Bladewhisper Chain Gloves of Journeys now has Cleave V as the worn effect. 
- Bladewhisper Chain Legguards of Journeys now has the focus of Alacrity of the Ikaav. 
- Summoned: Burning Shank should proc more often. 
- Eye of Yar`Lir is now called “Oculus of Yar`Lir”. 
- Bracelet of the Corrupter now has +2 mana regen. 
- Wristband of Spectral Corruption now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack. 
- Bracer of Corrupted Souls now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack. 
- Bracer of the Debauched now has +2 mana regen and +20 attack. 


*** Missions, Quests & Events *** 
------------------------------------ 
- Added the following new Dragons of Norrath missions 
House of the Autumn Rose (Norrath's Keepers Only) 
Plunder the Hoard (Dark Reign Only) 
A Goblin's Escort 
Halfling's Treasure Map 
Signal Fires 
Sudden Tremors 
These will show up on the usual mission givers once you have enough faction. 
- Modified the shards awarded for many of the Dragons of Norrath missions to better 
reflect how long they are taking to complete. 
- Changed the adventure “The Gilded Scroll” to fix some situations that could cause 
players to be unable to finish the mission. Now the Noble Kirin Scholar will not 
spawn before the real scroll is found. We also fixed a problem that could, in very 
rare cases, cause the real scroll not to be placed on an NPC. 
- The corrupted drake adds in the Vishimtar encounter will now respawn correctly 
after a failure. 
- Made a change to Burning Woods that should reduce the number of NPCs that get 
stuck under the world . This should make the hornets easier to find. 
- Increased the drop rate for the Collector's Fire Hornet Wing and Collector's Iksar 
Witch Doll. 
- We've extended the 6th anniversary scavenger hunt so that it will be available 
through Sunday, the 17th. 
- Changes were made to all Muramite Proving Ground trials. The major changes are: 
Adaptation is slightly easier, the trial of Ingenuity was significantly changed, 
and NPC resists in all single group trials were lowered. 
- Corrected a problem that was causing some NPCs in the Muramite Proving Grounds to 
show up in the wrong part of the zone. 
- In the Citadel of Anguish it's no longer possible to fight Arch Mage Vangl without 
completing the Keldovan, Jelvan, and Hanvar events first. 
- The Warden Hanvar encounter has been made more challenging; you may wish to bring 
some extra allies with you. 
- Beware, if you are too close to a wall the swarm adds in the Mata Muram encounter 
will spawn directly on top of you. 
- Increased the drop rate for the Tongue of the Zun’muram off Zun’Murum Tkarish Zyk 
in Txevu. 
- Changed the quest that gives alternative access to Txevu. When you hail the golem 
at the end of Inktu`ta it will check your items and flags and do the following: 
If you do not yet have a Qvic flag, the golem will give you the Splinter of the High 
Temple. 
If you do have a Qvic flag, the golem will give you whichever High Temple pieces you 
are missing. 
If you already have a Txevu flag, the Cipher of Txevu item, or all three fragments of 
the High Temple, the golem will ignore you. 
Likewise, when you complete the Qvic backflag, if you have the Splinter of the High 
Temple from completing Inktu`ta you will automatically receive whichever High Temple 
pieces you are missing. 
This change allows the combination of Inktu`ta and the Qvic backflag quest to count 
for Txevu access and the two can be completed in any order. This change is not retroactive. 
- A bug was fixed so that Alkron Wyrmsong will no longer give bards a cloth cap when 
an error is made during the quest for Epic 2.0 


*** NPCs *** 
------------------------------------ 
- Modified King Xorbb in Beholder. He will now drop Slime Crystal Staff 100% of the time. 
- Players can no longer attempt to give stacks of items to NPCs. The NPC would treat the 
stack as one item and you would lose the rest. There is now a check to help with people 
putting in a stack of items and losing them. 
- Items given to an NPC by a PC will no longer count as a Task item when looted. 
- NPC pathing code has been reviewed and some changes have been made which should 
prevent NPCs from becoming stuck and eventually becoming invisible. Please let us know 
if you see this happen any more. 
- The Cube Fragments in the Gates of Discord Sewer trials will no longer get stuck in 
the geometry. 
- The Soulbinder at the Firiona Vie outpost is now able to bind you to that area. 

*** Tradeskills *** 
------------------------------------ 
We have changed the chance to gain a skill up when using tradeskills. Previously there 
was a large increase in the average number of combines needed for a skill increase for 
skill values of 160 through 190. This made sense when 200 was the skill cap. We have 
changed the algorithm to remove the harsh spike in combines required for skill ups 
from 160 to 190, making it a more reasonable to increase all the way up to 300. For 
more details please see the post here: 
http://eqforums.station.sony.com/eq/board/message?board.id=Trade&message.id=5800 
- Alabaster Beak and Ivory Stormrider Canine are now marked as usable in tradeskills. 
- Dragons of Norrath brewing items now drop off NPCs. They were only available through 
foraging before. 
- Added the race name to the Unfired Cookie Cutters. New item names are: Unfired 
Barbarian Cookie Cutter, Unfired Gnome Cookie Cutter, Unfired Troll Cookie Cutter 
and Unfired Animal Cookie Cutter. 
- Added the recipes for four cookie cutters for Luclin beasties. The sketches and 
molds should be easily found on vendors. 
- Added the appropriate effects to Dragons of Norrath potions. 
- The recipe for dough made from Rock Hopper Egg now uses Rockhopper Egg. It turns 
out that there were two items with similar names, but the one used in the recipe 
doesn't drop in game. 
- Removed the recipe for chain jointing that was used in Planes of Power armor. This 
recipe was removed because the jointing is no longer used in any recipes. 
- You will now only need to collect half the number of items for the level 65+ Vah 
Shir racial armor pattern book quest. 


*** Server stability *** 
------------------------------------ 
- We believe we have corrected the problem with the excessive server lag that has 
been happening in most raid zones. A guild from one of our live servers was willing 
to come over to our test server and verify the raid in pofire was working properly 
without causing the zone to lag out. They were able to complete many of the stages
of the raid successfully and even multiple times without issue. There was one instance 
of a mob warping after getting in a bad location, but we have made vast improvements 
from its current state. We have also improved our logging code to better detect similar 
problems should they occur again in the future. Please let us know if you experience 
any problems related to this. 
- The memory leak problems that have recently been affecting the world servers has had 
much progress. Several memory leaks related to the previous update have been corrected, 
and server stability has improved measurably as a result. We will continue to monitor 
the servers closely for memory leak issues. 
- A zone crash in Chardokb related to the Korucust encounter has been fixed. 
- A zone crash related to guild tribute being toggled while a player was being charmed 
or feared has been fixed. 


*** Chat filtering *** 
------------------------------------ 
- Pet responses to commands (except for /pet leader) are no longer broadcast, but go 
only to the owner of the pet.* 
- Pet responses to commands can now have a selected color and be redirected to any chat 
window.* 
- Pet spell-casting messages can now have a selected color, be redirected to any chat 
window, and be filtered to not show at all.* 
- Assassinate, Deadly Strike, Slay Undead, and Finishing Blow messages will now be 
displayed in the Melee Critical message color and redirect/filter as other crits.* 


*** Mail System *** 
------------------------------------ 
- You now have quick access to all of your character mailboxes on the current server 
from any of your characters. 


*** Title Suffixes *** 
------------------------------------ 
- The title system now supports title suffixes. The first use of this new feature are 
the server titles. 


*** Guild Hall (Guilds) *** 
------------------------------------ 
- Added a guild tribute master to the guild hall. 
- The guild bank no longer accepts NORENT items. 
- Fixed a bug that allowed players with out the proper flags to remove items from the 
Guild bank. 
- Using any Eye of Zomm type spells in a guild hall will no longer take the client to 
server select. 


*** Bazaar/Barter *** 
------------------------------------ 
- Added and Augment pool and Augment Solvent Merchant in the Bazaar. 
- Added new search criteria to the Bazaar search: min level, max level. Any items 
which match all other search criteria, yet have a rec or req level outside the boundaries 
set in the new fields will not be returned by the search. 
- The barter UI code has been improved. There were some issues related to keeping the 
client properly synchronized with the server which have been fixed. It now more 
accurately tracks changes in inventory when multiple players are interacting with a 
buyer. Also, if a buyer has a LORE item, any buy-lines that require the LORE item will 
now automatically disable because the buyer would not be able to complete the 
transaction (because it would result in two lore items on the buyer). Previously 
this was causing a client-server sync issue that would result in a player being 
disconnected. 
- Barter Search Window: Right-clicking on the item sought by Buyers found in a search 
will display that item. You now have to right click on the Buyer's name to get the 
search path. 


*** UI *** 
------------------------------------ 
- Fixed an issue causing custom UIs to show bad data in unused buff slots. 
- The Task display now properly displays tasks with a large number of elements. 
- On character select, if you want to go back into the tutorial, just click the 
tutorial button below the list of characters. It is no longer a toggle button. 


*** Miscellaneous *** 
------------------------------------ 
- Increased the maximum level range spread for LDoN adventures from 7 to 10 so 
you can now group with someone 10 levels above or below you. 
- Critical heals now produce a message similar to other spells that crit. 
- Fixed corpse looting bugs for corpses that have been summoned or moved out of 
dynamic zones. 
- Closing multiple bags while using the bank no longer causes the client to crash. 
- The raid locking system had various bugs which are now fixed. Please let us know 
if you encounter any problems with the raid tool.

useful when replying to all: it helps you add new entries to your address book or update old 
ones. In the latter case, you will be notified of the differences: name differs by case, 
addresses removed, addresses added. The note field is preserved during the update. 

Address Book Window 
-New window to edit your address book. 
-Fields for name, addresses and note. 
-Checkbox to make the entry name private, which means that during address expansion, the addresses 
will be written as if you had selected them individually, not in the mailing list format. 
-Automatic update of the "Guild" entry. [Transient (not saved) and read-only.] If you leave the 
guild, the entry disappears. If someone is added/removed from the guild, your address book is updated. 

New Options Tab for the Mail System 
-Address book filename, configurable per character. 
-If you select an existing address book file, it loads it. 
-If you select a new filename, it creates it with the current in-memory address book state. 
-The address book can be edited by hand, or copied between installations. 

Mail Forwarding Option. 
-When turned on, incoming email is forwarded to the email address you registered in your Station 
Account. 

Revised Command-Line Syntax for Sending Mail 
-More than one recipient is now allowed. Use the comma to separate them. 
-If you need a space, for an example if you are sending to a mailing list that contains a space 
in its name, then you need to enclose the whole list of recipients between double-quotes. 
-To make a recipient BCC, precede it with a -. 
-Addresses written in the command-line are expanded according to the address book rules.

*** Spells *** 

- With the last patch, we made a change to the way that intoxication effects work so 
you are no longer completely immune to them if you have maximum alcohol tolerance. 
Instead, you now mitigate the effects based on your alcohol tolerance skill. Due to 
this change, intoxication effects have been reduced or removed from a number of detrimental 
NPC spells where they would now cause the encounters to be more difficult than intended. 
- Storm Guard and Frost Shield now have 60 minute durations. 
- Increased the range on Kessdona's Roar. 

*** Missions *** 

- Skrepiz Plaguebringer will now only appear when you have completed all previous requirements 
in the Rise of Marnek mission. 
- If you are on the mission to Unrest, Nisha Lightbrook will now respond to your first hail 
instead of requiring two hails for a response. 
- You will no longer be able to loot the notes for the Hate's Fury mission out of order. 

*** Items *** 

- Gloves of Wicked Ambition now have +5 to stun resist, +6 to dot shield, and +2 to mana regen. 
- Mirrored Mask now has a type 8 augmentation slot, by request. Now players can bind a focus 
augment to the item if they wish. 
- Gem of the Spring Wind from the good DoN camp is now named "Shard of the Spring Wind" and is 
now a type 7 and 8 augmentation. 

*** Alternate Abilities *** 

- Raised the cap on AA's so that those people who were maxed out can receive all of their 
Vet rewards. 
- The shape changing effects of the Jester of Bristlebane will now disappear after 10 minutes. 

*** Code *** 

Windows 98/ME: 
- Users with these operating systems should no longer experience the bug where there UI 
renders but the 3D scene does not when they first enter the game.

June 29, 2005 
------------------------------

A large patch was implemented today. Grab a coffee for this one. 

==================================

the zone will now get its own instance of the zone.

and a new player experience that will take you from level 1 to level 10. 
- New Newbie Armor Quests! - New armor quests pick up where the tutorial leaves off, taking 
players from 11 to 20. 
- You can now invite players to your group across zones. We have enabled the ability to use 
the /invite command with a players name to allow you to invite someone that is not in your 
current zone. 
- "Auto Consent Group", "Auto Consent Raid", and "Auto Consent Guild" buttons have been 
added to the options window; when checked, your group/raid/guild will automatically be given 
consent to move any new corpses you drop. 



*** Items *** 

- Ogre Femur Club is now monk and beastlord usable. 
- The tier1 and tier2 quested breastplates in Omens of War now have click effects that are 
usable from inventory.

item recast timer. This will give both items a visible indicator for the recast time of 
the rods when used in the UI.

*** Tasks, Missions, and Quests *** 

- Increased the amount of time that a mission zone can be empty of players before it 
shuts down from 15 to 30 minutes. This should help groups who completely wipe out get 
back to the zone before it shuts down and resets. 
- If you are on the mission to Unrest, Nisha Lightbrook will now respond to your first 
hail instead of requiring two hails for a response. 
- Sleeping on the job: Gnoll Archers will now call for reinforcements if you have killed 
them before completing the previous elements in the task.

impossible to complete.

- It should no longer be possible to get double-loot and double-lockout on the MPG 
Trial of Endurance.

on player death.

idea.

of course).

for 2 ticks.

- Leadership assist ranges now have the same distance rules as the /assist command.

*** Tradeskills *** 

- Added a minimum chance to gain a skill up on many of the Dragons of Norrath cultural 
tradeskill recipes and many of the Omens of War augmentation recipes. This will make it 
easier to gain an increase in skill when doing these recipes in most cases where the 
character has a high skill.

need to use the Velium Smithy Hammer in order to break down these weapons.

*** NPCs ***

as well as some of the ingredients that alchemists will need to make those potions. 
- The Taskmistress Krisz encounter can now be triggered. Speak to the NPCs in Riwwi for more 
information. 
- Several NPCs in the Abysmal Sea are now more willing to chat. They no longer require proof 
of dedication to their cause.

- Some of the Ferans in Riftseekers will drop Quality Feran Hides more often now.

- The Veteran Reward buffs are now immune to being dispelled. 
- The Veteran Reward buffs will no longer freeze their timers in the guild hall. 


*** Optimizations *** 

- File caching has been enabled which should yield performance improvements, especially 
on lower end systems when dealing with the UI (opening/closing windows, loading a UI, ...). 


*** Exodus and Related Issues *** 

- The exodus bug where a player could possibly die during the small amount of time after 
the spell is cast but before they actually zone, should now be fixed. We did the best we 
could trying to reproduce the situations that have been described to us and they have been 
fixed in our test cases. Please let us know if you continue to experience an issue like this. 
- Spells such as Exodus, have a chance to fail which happens for each person that gets hit 
by the spell. This means each person has a chance to not get ported. If you fail to get 
ported, you now receive a message notifying you of the failure. 
- Teleport bind(AA) will no longer leave the caster behind. If the spell is successfully 
cast, then everyone will be ported. Previously the caster had a 2% chance to not port.

- The Potion Belt will now remain visible after zoning (if it was visible before zoning). 
- The advanced display options window has been enhanced substantially. Please note that the 
Advanced Lighting option is for video cards that support 1.1 Pixel Shaders and above. Also 
note that the advanced lighting is still being tested with some of our known player hardware 
configurations. If you experience any issues with it on, please turn it off. Not all hardware 
combination have been verified to be fully functional. For those that can use it, check out 
how cool the lighting looks in some of the old zones like the commonlands with the NPCs and 
their spherical light influences. It looks great. 
- The help window has been merged with the petition window. 


*** Misc *** 

- You will no longer get experience back from a corpse whose rez timer has expired when 
using the Veteran AA Expedient Recovery. 
- The level restriction for entering the tutorial has been changed to allow level 10 and 
under. 
- Fixed an old issue with particles. If you had your client running for 10 or so hours, 
some particle emitters would start to show huge particles. 


*** Chat Channels *** 

- There are now system owned, persistent chat channels and players will auto join some of 
these channels. Players level 20 and under auto join the "NewPlayers" channel, over level 20 
auto join "General" and a class specific channel, and there are continent based channels as well. 
Auto joining channels can be disabled under the options window. 


*** Pet Commands *** 

- The "/pet follow" command works properly again. 
- The "/pet report" command works properly again.
