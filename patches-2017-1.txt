------------------------------


*** Highlights ***

- Changed the display of the 'Armor Class' statistic to show its component parts: 'Mitigation' and 'Evasion':
- - Although the new numbers are lower, your effective Armor Class is the same. These new numbers have always been used in combat calculations (see below for more details).


*** Items ***

- Increased the spell damage on some pieces of Selrach's armor so there is not a downgrade on the set between it and Cohort's armor.
- Corrected the name of the focus effect on Velazul's Soulrender Breastplate to be 'Deflection Discipline Duration' rather than 'Focused Arrowrain Fury'.
- Corrected a bug that prevented a number of Empires of Kunark items with activated spells from unlocking the correct passive Alternate Advancement ability.
- Mana of the Sarnak Compressor is now an eight slot container, allowing it to be used as an alternative for players without skills in tradeskills.


*** Quests And Events ***

- Atrebe's Vault (Raid and Group) - It should no longer be possible for the event to spawn NPCs when the raid is not in progress, for example shortly after a success or reset.
- Maestro of Rancor (PoP Era, Hateplaneb) (Raid) - Damaging Maestro will no longer prevent him from using his mechanics. For example, the accompanists will spawn at the organ even if he was reduced from 100% to 70% health in one tick.
- Innoruuk (PoP Era, Hateplaneb) (Raid) - It is no longer possible to kill the large version of Innoruuk without also killing the Evangelist of Hate first. This will prevent the raid from getting into a state where the untargetable Evangelist of Hate would spawn adds indefinitely.
- Atrebe Sathir (Raid) - Ultimate Siphon Pulse now drains mana and endurance instead of endurance and endurance.
- The Crystal Bloom (Group) - Wary ol' Krange, wary though he may be, has returned to the Korascian Warrens.
- Karana the Rainkeeper (Raid) - Restored a dialog that was intended to take place between Askr the Lost and Karana at the conclusion of this event.
- Drogan Toes - The first step will no longer suggest that you should get Drogan Toes from the quest giver, Vasyryx Teken`tlar.
- Drogan Toes - Fixed the hand-in of Drogan toes to Vasyryx in Frontier Mountains.
- Queen Velazul Di`Zok (Raid) - Queen Velazul in the Chardok raid event will now make it very clear when she casts Reflective Scales.
- The quest Guilds and the Guild Lobby again work correctly.
- Faldor Hendrys has returned from an over-a-decade-long vacation and can again be found in North Qeynos.
- Fixed some dialogue errors with Ralla Merow'shu in Chardok. She should now properly give out the quest Their Own Medicine.
- Removed dozens of bad LDoN adventure definitions that could send you to kill a low level Miragul's Menagerie spider in a high level Balancing Chambers Takish-Hiz dungeon.
- The brazier teleporters in Solusek Ro's Tower will no longer give a character a flag if they already have one. This should reduce lag and confusion.
- The items necessary to spawn Captain Krasnok in Hate's Fury can now be acquired much more easily.
- Fixed some issues with the Avatar of Wind, Avatar of Dust, Spider and 'Turkeybee' events in Plane of Air.
- Fixed an issue that was causing the Unstable Potion in the first Kor'Sha raid to not work properly.


*** Spells ***

- Improved messaging when a spell that you have cast has been overwritten:
- - Two new filterable chat colors have been created for beneficial and detrimental spells being overwritten.
- - The message 'Your Spellname spell on Target has been overwritten.' replaces the message 'Your Spellname spell has worn off of Target.' when your spell is overwritten by another spell.
- - This message will not display when a spell that you cast on yourself is overwritten by yourself.
- Bard - Increased the damage dealt by all four 'Chant' DoT/Debuff lines of spells.
- Bard - Added a cast time and duration to Soothing Psalm of the Sunrise so it will now work like most other songs.
- Wizard - Corrected an issue that caused the Vortex Effect debuff triggered from the Shocking Vortex line of spells to fade earlier than intended.


*** AA ***

- Fixed a bug with rank 4 of Trophy Collector that prevented it from functioning.


*** NPCs ***

- Many of the nobles in Kael Drakkel have shed their cumbersome armor and waxed their mustaches to return to the refined appearance they had pre-2005.


*** Progression Servers ***

- Fixed issue that could cause triggered bosses in Velious raid instances to spawn on zone up. Now they should not.
- Fixed several instances that would cause characters to be teleported to base zones instead of the instance, such as in Planes of Nightmare and Torment.
- Respawns should no longer happen in Phinigel progression server instances, except where they are important to boss fights.
- Vulak, Avatar of War, and Bazzt Zzzt in Phinigel progression server instances will no longer be up on zone startup and will have to be triggered using the expected method.
- Corrected some Progression-server-only requirements for Planes of Power zones. When Planes of Power launches they will require full flagging. Once Lost Dungeons of Norrath launches they will behave as they did from the first time zone access was increased (in 2003) until we again lowered their requirements during the Dragons of Norrath era. The 85/15 rule remains unchanged for these zones.
- - The Plane of Valor can now be entered at level 55 without other flags when Lost Dungeons of Norrath is open. This requirement lowers to level 46 when Dragons of Norrath opens.
- - The Halls of Honor can be entered at level 63 when Lost Dungeons of Norrath is open. This will now lower to 57 when Dragons of Norrath opens. Previously neither exception would work on Progression servers.
- - The Temple of Marr can now be entered at level 62 without other flags when Lost Dungeons of Norrath is open. This requirement now lowers to 57 when Dragons of Norrath opens. Previously there had not been an alternate level requirement for this zone on Progression servers until DoN unlocked it.
- - Drunder, the Fortress of Zek can now be entered at level 62 without other flags when Lost Dungeons of Norrath is open. This requirement will lower to 57 when Dragons of Norrath opens.
- - The Bastion of Thunder can now be entered at level 62 without other flags when Lost Dungeons of Norrath is open. This requirement will lower to 57 when Dragons of Norrath opens. Previously neither exception would ever take effect on Progression servers.
- - The Tower of Solusek Ro can now be entered at level 57 when Dragons of Norrath opens. Previously there was no alternate level requirement available at any time on Progression servers.
- - The Elemental planes (Air, Fire, Water, EarthA and EarthB) can only be entered via flag until Dragons of Norrath opens. At that point any level 60 will be able to enter these zones.
- Many Spell Research recipes are now restricted to an expansion at least three expansions after the spell itself is available.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- Enabled the free trade ruleset for items on Brekt.
- Enabled character transfers to Brekt, except from Firiona Vie.
- Made an adjustment to how NPCs on flight paths animate in order to reduce unnecessary pitching as they traverse through the air.
- Updated attack messaging for a number of NPCs races so that some creatures will 'sting, slice, maul, or claw' rather than 'hit'.
- Fixed an issue with fear spells that would often result in a zone crash. Occurred most commonly in the Revisited Plane of Fear.
- Made various fixes to punctuation and spelling:
- - Added missing direct address comma to many NPC phrases.
- - Added missing comma to set off speaker's tag for say and shout.
- - Corrected several misspellings of Cazic-Thule.
- - Added terminating punctuation to /yell texts.
- Many Planes of Power zones now have load balancing enabled.
- Addressed an issue where fellowship leaders were sometimes randomly changing when a world was restarted.
- Addressed an issue that was causing standard guild halls to not properly spawn.
- Fixed a typo in the faction name Drusella Sathir.
- Mitigation armor class granted from buffs will now function the same for players, player summoned pets, and mercenaries in that it will be subject to the armor class 'soft cap'.
- - This corrects an issue seen on the test server where player summoned pets and mercenaries had their total mitigation AC impacted by the soft cap.


*** UI ***

- Added a velocity label to the stats page of the inventory window which will display your current movement speed.
- Adjusted the formatting of AA ability descriptions to reduce the amount of scrolling necessary to view relevant information for most abilities.
- Changed the display of the 'Attack' statistic to show its component parts: 'Offense' and 'Accuracy':
- - The Offense stat increases your likelihood to deal more damage when you land a melee attack and is countered by your opponent's Mitigation stat.
- - The Accuracy stat increases your likelihood to land a hit on your opponent in melee combat and is countered by your opponent's Evasion stat.
- Changed the display of the 'Armor Class' statistic to show its component parts: 'Mitigation' and 'Evasion':
- - Although the new numbers are lower, your effective Armor Class is the same. These new numbers have always been used in combat calculations.
- - The Mitigation stat increases the likelihood for you to take less damage when you are hit by a melee attack and is countered by your opponent's Offense stat.
- - The Evasion stat increases the likelihood for you to avoid being hit by a melee attack and is countered by your opponent's Accuracy stat.
- - Spell descriptions that report the amount of Armor Class granted by buffs should now report a more accurate value.
- Inspecting a mount, illusion, or familiar item that triggers an additional blessing buff will now list that buff as a 'Blessing' rather than a 'Focus Effect'.
- - Inspecting an item with an activated effect that requires you to be able to equip the item to use will display 'Can Equip' before the casting time. This label will be highlighted in red if you cannot activate the item you are inspecting.
- Fixed an issue with the advanced loot window when looting a no drop item. This occurred only the first time after zoning when no drop confirmation was on.


- Changed -
EQUI_AAWindow.xml
EQUI_Inventory.xml


*** Previously Updated ***

- Fixed an issue that was preventing the Lceanium raid from working.
- Atrebe's Vault (Raid) - All NPCs in the event will now tether if pulled outside of the main room.
- Queen Velazul Di`Zok (Raid) - The event cleanup on success or failure should more reliably remove all adds in the event by not spawning adds as the event is resetting.
- The Last Grove - The Majestic Water Bucket can now be used in load balanced versions of Scorched Woods.
- The Vex Thal instance on progression servers will again spawn the Vex Thal bosses.

- Beastlord - Fixed an issue with Feral Swipe that caused its accuracy bonus to function as an accuracy penalty.
- Enchanter - Chromatic Haze and the effect of Gift of Hazy Thoughts will now increase the base damage of direct-damage spells that have a damage-over-time component; either increasing the initial direct-damage of a spell cast or increasing the base damage of the next damage-over-time tick of a qualifying spell.

- A goblin in Nurga was spawning outside the world. He is now back at home.
- Tuned down some charmed NPC combat values that were unintentionally stronger than non-charm combat values.

- - Two new sets of mercenary equipment have been created for Empires of Kunark. One set can be purchased for Sathir Trade Gems in Lceanium while the other set can be obtained as rare drops from basepop and rare creatures.

- - Increased the evasion, offense, and HP of melee damage mercenaries
- - Increased the evasion of spell damage mercenaries
- Identified and corrected an error with melee damage mercenaries that caused them to delete their innate haste item.
- Healer and damage caster mercenaries will now update their target when casting spells. This corrects an issue where casting target-of-target type spells would not resolve correctly when targeting a mercenary.

In addition to this, explore Norrath through the anniversary quest “Tsaph’s Day Off.”

*** Quests And Events ***

- Run, You Fools! (Group) - Fixed an issue that could cause the completion of the "By The Power of Dead Skulls" achievement in this mission to be unreliable. It should be more reliable now. If you let Taros get the final hit on enough targets, you should get the achievement.
- On Behest of the Emperor and Others' Things (Heroic Adventures) - These no longer share a replay timer.
- The Prince (Raid) - Added a specific message when the Prince has become fully enraged.
- Unstable Creation (Raid) - This no longer requires 18 players to trigger once House of Thule has been open on that server for 3 months or more.

- - Beastlord, Magician, and Necromancer pets between level 81 and 85 using Enhanced Minion VII - XII
- - Magician and Beastlord pets between level 71 and 75 using Enhanced Minion I and II
- Druid - Reduced the efficiency of some Damage over Time spells that were combined in last month's update.
- Druid - Lowered the damage dealt by all spells in the Chill of the Natureward line.
- Shaman - Converted Falhotep's Malosenia and Livio's Malosenia to cast the highest rank you know of their component spells. You will now be charged the correct cost for the DoT they use. Higher ranks of these spells have lower recast times.
- Shaman - DoT spells that were consolidated in the last update are now less efficient and will do less damage than before. They will still do substantially more damage than before they were consolidated.
- Shaman - Corrected a problem that made Sephry's Malady (and earlier spells in the line) do less damage per tick than Breath of Hemocoraxius (and earlier spells in that line).


*** NPCs ***

- It is no longer possible to spawn infinite black reaver NPCs in City of Mist by setting up a situation where the encounter cannot spawn the unique NPC because it's already up.


*** Progression Servers ***

- Event NPCs in The Halls of Betrayal (ChardokB), The Caverns of Exile (SoldungC), The Plane of Mischief, and Veksar will be treated as bosses.

- Veksar, The Halls of Betrayal (ChardokB), and The Caverns of Exile (SoldungC) now have load balancing enabled.
- All Legacy of Ykesha zones have load balancing enabled.
- The number of characters necessary to trigger a new load balanced zone (pickzone) has been adjusted to better reflect the amount of combatable population in each zone. In the vast majority of cases, the threshold has been lowered, meaning it will be easier to trigger the new pickzone, requiring fewer characters in a zone to do so than before the update.
- Additionally, when a pickzone's population drops below the threshold, it may lock. Players will be alerted when a pickzone locks and will have 15 minutes to leave the zone before it closes. If players do not leave, they will get teleported to the main zone after the time expires.
- Fixed an issue that could cause Address Book files with invalid filenames to get generated in the client directory.
- Fixed an issue where the Looking For Players information wouldn't properly display for the guild that is looking for players. Search Guilds was unaffected and would still show the guild in the search results.
- Changed the chat color description for 'Membership Restriction Messages' to 'System Messages' to properly reflect what they're actually used for. This aligns with the Chat Filter 'System Messages'.


*** UI ***

- Added the item overflow window available through /itemoverflow. This window will be utilized in the future.
- Fixed a bug that could cause an item description to not properly appear for some abilities.
- Added the ability to enable the display of timestamps in your chat windows.
- - The display of timestamps defaults to off but can be customized per window.
- - Available formats are hh:mm:ss, hh:mm, or mm:ss.
- - The default color of timestamp text matches the color of the chat channel it corresponds to. This setting can be toggled, and the timestamps can instead display in a uniform custom color per window.

- Corrected the lore text on Giant Dire Wolf Skin.

*** Quests & Events ***

- Atrebe (Raid) - Reworked the way the event works to ensure that the Everything Reborn achievement will function and the event will be easier to understand. Now there will only ever be four Haulers. They will try to pick up every ancient iksar or iksar skeleton corpse, rather than leaving some as they did before.
- Atrebe (Mission) - Reworked the way the event works to ensure that the Everything Reborn achievement will function and the event will be easier to understand. Now there will only ever be four haulers. They will try to pick up every ancient iksar or iksar skeleton corpse, rather than leaving some as they did before. So to get the achievement you must allow them all to be animated by Atrebe. As a minor fix, the haulers will visibly pick up their burdens rather than just making them disappear.
- The anniversary decorations in the Plane of Knowledge will take no more than one minute to populate or depopulate when the anniversary has started or ended.

- Bane of Decay (Mission) - The skulls will no longer have a massive amount of hit points.


*** Spells ***

- Most lower level Druid and Shaman DoT spells now do as much or slightly more damage as the equivalent spell plus the two spells before it when the spells originally stacked. Mana costs of these spells have increased accordingly.
- - These changes apply to the shaman Curse, Blood of Saryrn, and Breath of Ultor lines and the druid Sunscorch and Stinging Swarm lines.
- Corrected a bug that prevented some combat abilities that trigger a short-duration buff on the caster from being usable while a discipline was running. Ex: The Monk ability 'Drunken Monkey Style' or 'Breather'.

- Monk - The Doom component of Curse of the Thirteen Fingers has been adjusted to generate less aggro.
- Berserker - Frenzied Resolve has been changed to function as a discipline and has been renamed 'Frenzied Resolve Discipline'.

- Addressed an issue that could cause Real Estate Anchors to not properly function.
- Hunter and Raid achievements have been added for original EverQuest and Ruins of Kunark zones.


*** UI ***

*** UI ***

- - For Master Looter, the window will still pop up unless you have already marked all of the items in the list as auto ask/roll.
- The reminders for claim items and veteran rewards displayed when logging in will now only display once per week and only for level 5 or higher characters.

- Fixed a bug that prevented the player name left-click context menu from working correctly if chat timestamps were enabled.
- Added the option 'missingSpells' to the /outputfile command.
- - Running this command will output a list of any spells usable by your class up to your current level that you haven't yet scribed in your spellbook.
- The Claim window will now display information about the highlighted claim. Generally this will describe where the claim came from. However, in a few cases the information will also indicate what servers the item can be claimed on, if that item has server restrictions.
