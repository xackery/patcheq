------------------------------

*** Highlights *** 

- A series of quests have been created within and around the Secrets of Faydwer expansion. See Fenden Helter in the Ladies of the Light tower for more information. These tasks include various Secrets of Faydwer faction rewards as well as a new currency that can be used to purchase items from Fenden. 

- The spell information window has been changed. For buffs that are on you or your pet, you will be able to see the name of the caster, the full duration of the spell, the level required to cast the spell, the skill required to cast the spell, the mana cost of the spell, and the spell description. Non existing buff based spells will display the total duration of the spell in a new format, hours, minutes, and seconds.

- New visual indicators have been added to the buff window icons, and short duration buff window icons. Additionally, the spell counter information has been moved to facilitate the visual display of the buff timer on the respective buff icon. There have been four pieces of visual information added to the buff icons. This includes a visual indicator to show each of four possible pieces of information. The new pieces of information are Buff Timer, Buff Counters, Song Timer, and Song Counters. 

- With the description changes added, all relevant counter information for BARD songs, all short duration effects, and regular buffs in either the spell window buff icon or short duration buff icon respectively will also be displayed. 

- The buff icon will now display the time remaining in the form of hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s) whichever is greater. This significantly reduces the amount physical space used on the icon to print out the remaining time, in effect showing more of the buff or short duration buff icon to the print out the remaining time, in effect showing more of the buff or short duration buff icon to the player. 

- Several NPCS in the Barren Coast, The Buried Sea, Attiki, Katta Castrum, and Goru'kar Mesa have been lowered in difficulty to help facilitate easier soloing for many players. These NPCs will have a special consider message to indicate they are easier than your average NPC. 

*** Returning Players *** 

- If you're returning to the game following a break, be sure to visit the Scholars in the northeast portion of the Plane of Knowledge. They can help guide you through the many changes to the land of Norrath over the years. 

*** Items *** 

- Fixed some typographical errors in a few instruction manuals. 
- Ornament Mutation Tools are now available for purchase from Magus Alaria in the Guild Lobby. They can be used to permanently change Ornament items into single use Ornamentation containers. 
- Secrets of Faydwer monk armor will now have the special monk appearance. Armor that monks share with other classes was unchanged. 
- Added Battlerager's Strength to SoF Raid Tier 3 and 4 Berserker Class Gloves. 
- Changed the colors on the Bridles of the Commanded and Ferocious Ferans to match the image on their cards. 

*** Quests & Events *** 

- A series of quests have been created within and around the Secrets of Faydwer expansion. See Fenden Helter in the Ladies of the Light tower for more information. These tasks include various Secrets of Faydwer faction rewards as well as a new currency that can be used to purchase items from Fenden. 
- The bears in Wulfnor the Gladiator's event in Frostcrypt will once again look like bears. 
- Eron in the Dragonscale Hills has figured a slightly better method for making spools of energized brownie hair. You can now make it if the denizens of the zone are nearby. It still requires that you be by the specific energy charge within the main power room, and not any of the auxiliary power rooms. Be aware that being in the energy charge is painful and not compatible with invisibility or stealth. This new method will also not work if you are lying down. You will not need to go back to him to get the new method, as he has communicated it to everyone. 

*** NPC *** 

- Brinda's assistant, Findlewill, has returned from a restful vacation and can now be found in the Mansion. 
- Several golems have had their body type switched to Construct. 
- Fixed several minor text errors on various NPCs. 
- Several NPCS in the Barren Coast, The Buried Sea, Attiki, Katta Castrum, and Goru'kar Mesa have been lowered in difficulty to help facilitate easier soloing for many players. These NPCs will have a special consider message to indicate they are easier than your average NPC. 

*** Spells *** 

- Made a change to all spells and abilities that use Fade-like functionality to no longer kill your pets, auras and familiars when the Fade-like ability is used.- Fixed an issue causing negative focus effects to not function correctly (sorry!)- With the changes made for displaying the spell decriptions, there may be some NPC spells that display incorrect data. We will be adjusting these descriptions at a later time. The description shoud not affect gameplay.- The shadowknight Decrepit Skin line, paladin Ward of Tunare spell line, and druid Skin of the Reptitle spell line have been adjusted.- Upon death, Divine Arbitration should no longer split the influence to the group members.- Shaman spell Ancestral Intervention and the druid spell Survival of the Fittest should be able to produce a crit again. 

*** Tradeskills *** 

- NPC pricing of powersources have been altered. 

*** Tasks *** 

- Fixed one of the chests in the Uncovered Treasure task that was spawning under the world. 
- Fixed various issues in the new Secrets of Faydwer tasks that start with Fenden Helter in Dragonscale Hills. 

*** AA *** 

- Changes have been made to the Harm Touch ability for Shadow Knights. The Ranks of Harm Touch that are purchased via AA points (and not automatically granted) will now have an immediate amount of damage as well as a Damage Over Time component. The Damage Over Time component is in addition to the damage that Harm Touch previously did. The Damage Over Time will scale along with the maximum value of the instant damage for each rank. 
- Increased the duration of Pact of the Wurine AA. 
- A number of AA lines that had a previously meaningless recast delay have been changed to have no recast delay. This is to address larger-than-intended returns on Heal Amount mods being applied due to how the calculations for those spells work. The AA lines changed include: Act of Valor, Hand of Piety, Lay on Hands, Mend Companion, Rejuvenate Companion, Replenish Companion, and Touch of the Divine. 

*** Zones *** 

- We've adjusted the fog settings in all zones to allow for better visibility.- Adjusted pathing around the Goblin huts in the Buried Sea. 

*** Miscellaneous *** 

- More fixes for corpse looting problems when using /hidecorpse looted.- Added the Background FPS slider to the Options->Display window. Allows setting the frame rate for the EQ window when it is not the foreground window. Sliding all the way to the left (the default) will use "Min. CPU" mode. Increasing this above "Min. CPU" can improve auto-follow behavior when the client is not in the foreground.- 'alpha' and 'ralpha' added to /tracksort command.- Added new SoF stats to the bazaar search options.- Fixed a problem causing a client disconnect when consuming or using the last item in a stack.- Made an optimization that will slightly improve lag in loping plains. This is not a full fix.- Changed the way CPU affinity assignment works so that when you have multiple clients running and exit one and restart it, you still get correct distribution of CPU assignment. Previously, this could cause both clients to be assigned to the same CPU. 

*** User interface *** 

- Moved the Max FPS and Max background FPS sliders to the advanced display options window.- The spell information window has been changed. For buffs that are on you or your pet, you will be able to see the name of the caster, the full duration of the spell, the level required to cast the spell, the skill required to cast the spell, the mana cost of the spell, and the spell description. Non existing buff based spells will display the total duration of the spell in a new format, hours, minutes, and seconds. 
- New visual indicators have been added to the buff window icons, and short duration buff window icons. Additionally, the spell counter information has been moved to facilitate the visual display of the buff timer on the respective buff icon. There have been four pieces of visual information added to the buff icons. This includes a visual indicator to show each of four possible pieces of information. The new pieces of information are Buff Timer, Buff Counters, Song Timer, and Song Counters. 
- With the description changes added, all relevant counter information for BARD songs, all short duration effects, and regular buffs in either the spell window buff icon or short duration buff icon respectively will also be displayed. 
- The buff icon will now display the time remaining in the form of hours (h), minutes (m), or seconds (s) whichever is greater. This significantly reduces the amount physical space used on the icon to print out the remaining time, in effect showing more of the buff or short duration buff icon to the print out the remaining time, in effect showing more of the buff or short duration buff icon to the player.

*** Highlights ***

- Station Voice: Station Voice is a voice chat service powered by Vivox and included with certain SOE game subscriptions. Station Voice allows players to talk person-to-person in-game at no additional cost. Players can go far beyond basic real-time chat with the usual headset and microphone setup that is commonly used today, and will be able to access a suite of voice communication tools.

Upcoming features are scheduled to include voice mail, the ability to receive external calls, and voice fonts to synthesize player voices into in-game character voices. Station Voice will be hosted and managed on the Vivox Network. Game software and headsets sold separately. Station Voice is also present in EverQuest II and Star Wars Galaxies.

Features at Launch in EverQuest include:

-- Talk person-to-person in game with any microphone and headset combo. 
-- Chat with your party, guild or any other group in game. 
-- Create automatic channels for guilds, raids and groups. 
-- Play and communicate without worry of a significant increase in game lag. 
-- Manage group/user participation with moderator controls. 
-- Individually mute and set volume per user Create automatic channels for guilds, raids and groups. 
-- Set up easily without the need for separate software, accounts or registration.

(For details on Station Voice see below under the UI changes.)

- Group Merge Ability: Looking to fill the last few spaces of your group? Groups now have the ability to merge with each other without disbanding from their own group!

With this new feature, the group leader of one group can invite the group leader of another group to join his/her group. If the invitation is accepted, the two groups will merge together to form one group.

This change merely allows groups to merge without having to make everyone drop out of their current group. All other group functionality should work as it did in the past. It does not increase the six person group maximum for groups.

- Weightless Coinage: Coinage no longer adds to the weight of player characters. Adventurers all across Norrath rejoice... especially monks!


*** Items ***

- The spirit of Dain Frostreaver will be very angry if the Ancient Frostreaver or Ancient Longhandled Frostreaver are used by anyone else.
- The Skullstepper should be usable by any race that includes the classes on it. Really.

*** Spells ***

- Tears of Qandieal returns to its changed state. It now destroys the target's mana and inflicts damage based on the mana destroyed.


*** NPC ***

- A recast timer has been placed on the NPC version of Lay on Hands. The player version of this spell is not affected by this change.


*** Quest & Events ***

- The Demi-Plane version of Mayong's swipe attack will now properly ignore the top player of his hatelist.
- The lockout from Bimbalicus the Soulbleeder's event will be 4.5 days from now on.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- Guild Banners will again be sustainable with only one guild member in the zone.
- Weightless Coinage: Coinage no longer adds to the weight of player characters. Adventurers all across Norrath rejoice... especially monks!
- The timer for returning to the game after going linkdead with a character has been reduced from 3 minutes to 1 minute.


*** UI ***

- Station Voice Comes to EverQuest!

- How does it work in EverQuest? -
To begin using voice chat, verify the feature is enabled by opening the Option window (Alt+O) and navigating to the Voice tab. This feature will be turned off by default.

Devices: Once Voice Chat is enabled EverQuest will attempt to connect to the correct hardware.

Push-to-talk key: Initially the voice chat system uses Ctrl+Tab as the push-to-talk key. This can be reconfigured to any available key from the Options window, Keys tab.

Output volume: Master volume for all incoming Voice Chat traffic. This setting is independent of music and sound effect volume settings. Setting this to high results in distortion of incoming speech.

Input volume: The relative sensitivity of your microphone. Turning it up means your microphone picks up quieter sounds. Setting this to high results in distortion of your outgoing speech. The sound indicator gives an estimate of the distortion. Red signifies high distortion, yellow medium distortion and green low distortion.

Testing your setup with Echo channel: The echo channel allows you to get an idea of your settings by broadcasting what you say back to you after a short delay. 

- The Voice Bar -
Once Voice Chat is enabled and has successfully connected the Voice Bar will automatically be shown. The Voice Bar by default will remain active as long as voice chat is enabled. A hot key may be mapped to open and close the Voice Bar.

The Voice Bar offers a push to talk button, a list of users of the current channel, what channels are available, a link to Options, and indication of who is currently talking.

The Talk button is simply a push-to-talk button that is mouse activated instead of keypress activated. 
The Voice Users button presents a list of the users of the current channel. Clicking on the speaker by any user allows you to adjust the volume of that player relative to your master volume. A particularly loud player can be turned down relative to other voice chat traffic Moderators for a channel are given additional options of muting a player for the entire channel, banning a player from the channel and kicking a player from the channel.

The channel button pulls down a menu of channels available to you. The currently selected one is shown in green if connected. Red if the connection has failed. Unselected but available channels are shown in white. 

Voice chat has been integrated into some other interfaces in the game. Speaker icons show up for players that have voice chat active. The speaker icons behave as they do in the Voice Users window, giving access to Voice Chat options specific to that player.

There is currently an issue with leaving a private channel making you unable to invite someone to a new private channel. We are working on resolving this issue, but until then, logging out and back in should clear your channel status.

- Using the /voicechat Command -
The /voicechat command offers the following options:

-- on: activate voice chat (ex. /voicechat on) 
-- off: deactivate voice chat 
-- Moderator Controls: 
-Mute <player> - mutes a player for everyone in the current channel
-Unmute <player>- unmutes a player for everyone in the current channel
-Kick <player>- kicks a player form the current channel
-Ban <player> - bans a player from the current channel and kicks them if they are present
-Unban <player> - unbans a player from current channel

The Tides of Anachronism

All across Norrath and beyond, the boundaries between past and present and between parallel realities seem to be fraying. 

Within the normally peaceful Plane of Knowledge, three heralds of Druzzil Ro entered the realm; bringing warnings of troubled and dangerous times ahead.

"Danger has arrived! Our time is very short! Time is ticking and our doom may have arrived! As it passes, time takes with it portions of our lives. Well, your lives. And now it threatens to take all of our lives. Powers of chaos and destruction are taking their time, taking our time! Go quickly, time is so very short."

Meanwhile, over in the Dreadlands, a retired scholar named Deckarn Mystglade is seeking someone to help keep him from losing his mind.

A few years back when the Plane of Time was first breached by Norrathian adventurers, Deckarn warned his fellow scholars that interfering with the realm of time would only lead to disaster. After continuously trying to prophesize his unproven theories, he was forcibly requested to retire. Since then, Deckarn has been a bit unsure of anything around him.

Over the past few weeks, Deckarn has been feeling a strange shift in time and began to have visions of epic battles, re-building, corruption, decay, and war. Uncertain of himself, he needs someone to investigate the mysterious occurrences in his visions to confirm that he isn't going insane.

Curious adventurers begin to travel to the Plane of Knowledge and the Dreadlands to hear the rumors first hand.


*** Items ***

- The Raging Taelosian Alloy Axe and the Vengeful Taelosian Blood Axe have been modified. The Strike of Savagery effect will no longer have a chance to proc itself. Instead, the duration of the effect has been increased to 1 minute.
- The tribute value of the mass enchant spells has been adjusted. It is not intended that infinitely purchasable items have a tribute value greater than their platinum cost.


*** Spells ***

- Tears of Qandieal and similar spells can now only be cast on NPCs to address a stability issue. The ability to use it against players will return with our next code update.


*** Upcoming UI Changes ***

- Message to custom UI users: With the next Game Update, we will be releasing several extensive changes to the User Interface (UI). Some of these changes can currently be found on the Test Server and additional changes may be released throughout the week. Please take a moment to visit the Test Server so that you can prepare ahead of time for these changes.

*** Highlights ***

- Seeds of Destruction Zone Sneak Preview: All active EverQuest subscribers with accounts in good standing will be able to experience all new EverQuest Seeds of Destruction zones two week before commercial release! During this special event players can participate in quest lines and group encounters as they assist Antonius Bayle and preserve the future of Qeynos! Zones include the eerie devastation of the Void, the lush wilderness of Oceangreen and the perilous Temple of Bertoxxulous. Beginning October 7, 2008 seek out the herald of Druzzil Ro in the Plane of Knowledge to be transported to a time rift that leads to the preview content!

- Group Merge Ability: Looking to fill the last few spaces of your group? Groups now have the ability to merge with each other without disbanding from their own group! With this new feature, the group leader of one group can invite the group leader of another group to join his/her group. If the invitation is accepted, the two groups will merge together to form one group. This change merely allows groups to merge without having to make everyone drop out of their current group. All other group functionality should work as it did in the past. It does not increase the six person group maximum for groups.

- Group Window Enhancements: The following changes have been made to improve the Group Window - We've added mana and endurance gauges for group members. We've added a Group Roles infrastructure. When right-clicking on a member of the group, a leader will now have the roles sub-menu for role administration. If currently the leader of a group, right-clicking the player's health / mana / stamina window will also show the same role administration menu. We also added in the /grouproles command. A group role indicator was also added to the Player Info window.

- Target Window Enhancements: The following changes have been made to improve the Target Window - The target window will now display the buffs on target players, pets, and in the future mercenaries. The Inspect Buffs leadership ability is still needed to view NPC buffs. The target's buff timers displays in hours, minutes, seconds. We've added the ability to remove buffs from yourself, your pet, and in the future mercenaries from the target window. The ability to block buffs on you and your pet has also been added to the target window. The Target Window is now resizable.

- More Firiona Vie Character Slots: We've extended the amount of character slots available on the Firiona Vie server to 3 characters.

- Message to Custom UI Users: Due to the amount of changes being made to the user interface with this game update, custom UI users are advised to switch to the default before attempting to log in or if you experience difficulties when logging in.


*** Fan Faire Requests ***
These changes were made due to some of the feedback received at the 2008 Las Vegas Fan Faire.

-Added the ability for players to target nearest corpse and cycle through the nearest corpses via hotkeys. These will need to be set in the options menu to be used. 
-Increased the range of emotes to match the range of say. 
-Fixed an issue with damage shield mitigation on items. 
-/target will now target the player instead of their familiar, as long as the player is within a reasonable distance of their familiar. 
- We now display all bind points for a player when using /charinfo.


*** Spells ***

- A new resurrection spell has been added for Druids and Shaman. Wanderer Astobin and Mystic Abomin in the Plane of Knowledge library have the scroll for sale. The spell returns 90% of a player's lost experience and can only be used while out of combat.


*** AA ***

- Removed the group leadership AA Designate Main Assist since this functionality is given to all groups through the new Group Role system. Leadership AAs spent on this ability have been refunded in the form of regular AAs.
- Certain AA's that added extra riposte chances will no longer cause your non-rogue enemies to backstab you.


*** Quest & Events ***

- Monks should no longer get left behind after completing the Seventh Hammer portion of their Epic quest.
- Paladins should no longer get left behind after completing the Mujaki the Devourer event for their Epic quest.


*** Miscellaneous ***

- Items and coin are no longer left on a corpse upon death. The items will remain equipped and in their respective containers.
- Spells will now remain memorized on a character upon death.
- Players should now be able to equip items for which they don't meet the required level. In the inventory window, the item will be highlighted in yellow if the required level is not met. No benefits will be granted from this item other than being able to equip it.
- Added the concept of revive effects. When you respawn, you will receive negative effects for a while to compensate for having all your equipment and spells still memorized.
- /target will now choose PCs over NPCs when using a partial name.
- If you have a familiar buff but no familiar, it should no longer destroy any other pets you have when you remove the buff.
- All classes now keep their familiar buffs when the familiar is killed or dismissed, not just wizards.
- Fixed a problem with familiars for pet classes. If you have a pet, then summon a familiar, then zone, it will now keep your pet properly with only the familiar buff.
- Fixed some problems with the muted friends list for voice chat.
- Corrected a few issues with group and raid management functions.
- Groups are now somewhat persistent. If you log out and log back in you will still be in your group. Offline players should still be able to be kicked out of groups.
- Fixed a problem with /hidecorpse looted where the client and zone could get out of sync and keep you from looting for a while after that.
- Added /hidecorpse npc which works just like /hidecorpse all except it only hides NPC corpses.
- Drakkin rogues will now sneak at the correct speed when over level 50.
- Added in Group Roles infrastructure. When right-clicking on a member of the group, a leader will now have the roles sub-menu for role administration. If currently the leader of a group, right-clicking the player's health / mana / stamina window will also show the same role administration menu. Also, added in the /grouproles command. A group role indicator was also added to the Player Info window.
- Group members in other zones will now be notified when their group member (that previously logged off) logs back in (grey when they're offline, white when they're online). Their name in the group window changes color as indicated for online/offline status.


*** Voice Chat ***

- Slash versions of the commands are effective on playername for the channel you are in and only if you are the moderator (raid/guild/group leader)
- Unban only works via slash command since there the banned player is no longer in the channel and therefore no longer available to click on.
- /voicechat unban playername
-Unban only works to unban playername in the channel you are currently in, and only if you are the moderator (raid/guild/group leader)


*** UI ***

Several changes have been made regarding the design of user interface windows. Some of the changes are noted below:

- The group leader will now be displayed in a different color in the group window and player window. This will work in addition to /groupleader to find out who the group leader is.
- Updated the pet window to display timers in hours, minutes, seconds like the buff window.
- "Caster:" in the buff info window will now display the user name. Also, if there is no caster information available, the "Caster:" line should not appear.
- Added the ability to click on a group member and target out of zone / link dead group members. Using the function keys by default should also bring up the players in the target window.
- Invite, follow and disband/decline buttons are no longer required in the group window.
- Modified the spell gem window to auto-resize based on the number of spell gems activated via Mnemonic Retention.
- Added the ability when using custom UI's to target out-of-zone group members by clicking on their EQType's gauge.
- Fixed a bug seen in custom UI's where the spell name in the buff and short term buff windows would be "Unknown Spell" when there was no buff in that slot.
- In the group window, the gauge size can now be used by custom UI modifiers to set the size for gauges instead of having to change the background size.

------------------------------

A sneak peek of the patch message to go with the launch of Seeds of Destruction: Note this message will probably receive a few additions before the Game Update goes live. 

*** Highlights *** 

*** Seeds of Destruction *** 

Welcome to EverQuest Seeds of Destruction, the 15th expansion for EverQuest! 

A new rift has opened in the Plane of Time. This rift leads to a bleak prophecy of the end of existence. The world of Norrath lies in ruins. The planet has shattered into millions of shards, spinning in a silent void around the rapidly blackening star of Ro.

In the wreckage on a small shard of the world, a lone figure sits quietly tending a small seedling growing between the rocks. The lone figure is none other than the fallen god Zebuxoruk. 

Zebuxoruk is certainly insane, but has a unique insight into the current state of the world and possibly might hold the knowledge to guide adventurers in the quest to prevent the destruction of Norrath. Only he can direct adventurers towards specific moments in time where the armies of Discord were able to disrupt the timeline. 

If they are able to stop the forces of Discord, the destruction in The Void will slowly be repaired. If not, all hope will be lost. 

- Level Cap Increase: Players can now achieve level 85. New high level item sets, new Alternate Advancement ability lines, new spells, and new skill caps come with this increase. 

- New Content: New themed realms for adventurers to explore including Oceangreen, Bloody Kithicor, Field of Bone, Invasion of Earth, Kuua, and Discord. Travel through the rift in Time solo, with a group, or in raids to complete new quests, tasks, and events to acquire new items, spells, tradeskill recipes, and abilities. 

- Mercenaries: Mercenaries are NPCs for hire that will aid adventurers in their heroic endeavors. Their levels and abilities will scale appropriately and they will think and act for themselves with limited player guidance. They are designed for extra support or extra muscle in PvE encounters. 

Unlike player pets, these NPCs are not directly controllable by players, though the player can give them general orders, but rather function like a normal party member including taking up a group slot and taking a share of the experience. 

Mercenary Liaisons can be found in all starting cities and will allow you to hire mercenaries based on their race. The Liaisons within the Plane of Knowledge and Oceangreen Village will allow you to hire mercenaries of any player race. These merchants can be found using the Find ability. 

Before purchasing a mercenary be sure to read the descriptions, cost value, and restrictions. There are different levels and tiers available. Some mercenaries may not available until you have completed certain content but there are some apprentice and journeyman ones available to all. 

There are two classes of Mercenaries available - Tank and Healer. 

Healer Mercenary: Healer mercenaries prefer to heal their owner and others in the group rather than engage directly in combat. These mercenaries can also resurrect players upon death. 

Tank Mercenary: Tank mercenaries prefer to melee. They will taunt if it is set to the main tank role. Though it will still attack and behave as a secondary tank if it is not set as main tank. 

Mercenaries can be suspended like a pet. There are some zones that will automatically suspend your mercenaries upon entering the zone. 

*** Live Highlights *** 

- New Statue in Guild Hall: As a part of SOE's EverQuest and EverQuest II Living Legacy celebration that took place this summer, SOE and the Legends of Norrath team searched for two enthusiastic players who have what it takes to be immortalized in their favorite MMOs! Everyone was invited to submit their photos for this special contest. Out of all the submissions, Khyandys Aramyndan of the Altruistic Valorians guild on the Erollisi Marr server was selected as the winner for EverQuest!

*** Test Server *** 

- HP, Mana, and Endurance calculations have been adjusted to address a few unintended inconsistencies. 

We've identified the unintended inconsistencies in the HP/Mana/Endurance formulae that were causing inflated values. We've readjusted the values to be more in line with expectations and to help prevent problems like this in the future. 

The net result of these adjustments will be that everyone should see a benefit Over the values present at the launch of Seeds of Destruction, although you will notice a drop from the most recent values if you're level 81+. 

This change is now available for testing over on the Test Server. You can use /testcopy on the live servers to get your character copied to the Test Server to check out the changes. 

*** Live Servers *** 

*** Hotfix *** 

- The Dragorn in Kuua have become strangely weaker. It appears the Muramite forces may have gained the upper hand.

- Adjusted the stacking of Second Spire of Enchantment (Enchanter AA). 
- Re-enabled the SoD AA Extended Ingenuity. Bards, Monks, Warriors, Rogues and Berserkers will now be able to purchase this AA. 
- The AA Fortified Entanglement (Wizard) now requires the purchase of Hastened Root 4 to resolve a conflict between these two AAs, making your roots less reliable if you had not purchased both. 
- The heal over time component of the highest ranks of Lay on Hands will now go to the short buff window. 
- The Ranger AA Hastened Trueshot will now focus the Sureshot Discipline. 
- The Rogue AA Sleight of Hand should now stack with the Envenomed Blades AA. 
- Veil of Mindshadow spells will now have a wear off message. 

*** Zones *** 

- Replaced the missing door on the merchant vs. merchant ship instances in the Buried Sea. 
- Savet Ironstove now properly advertises what he sells. 

*** Mercenaries *** 

- Healer mercenaries will give less priority to healing shamen that are not flagged as the main tank role and that are not being directly attacked. This should allow them to be a bit friendlier with regards to cannibalize. 
- Mercenaries should be friendlier to feign splitting techniques. If the puller feigns in camp before the merc has a chance to react, the merc will not attack the mobs hostile only to the puller. 
- Mercenaries will no longer attack enemies that are currently engaging targets outside their group (or group's pets). 
- The camp radius now scales somewhat dynamically in that if your group is widely spaced, the radius around the group's center considered "in camp" to the AI is increased to avoid a situation where you've pulled an NPC past one of the group's members, but the AI still does not react to it. The minimum camp radius from group center is still 50feet as it was before. 
- Healer mercenaries will no longer cast heal spells on themselves that have an invulnerability component, as the AI was never tuned to do this at the right time, and it leads to problems with the mercs appearing to be unresponsive. 
- Increased the timer for how often a merc will attempt to resurrect a corpse when the res is not accepted from 2 minutes to 5 minutes. 
- The ability to suspend/un-suspend a mercenaries is now locked when in combat and when the player still has a cool-down timer on PvP servers. For standard rule servers, the cool-down timer still does not factor into this, suspend/un-suspend can be done immediately after the hatelist is cleared. 
- Tank mercenaries will now default to following their owner (or group) when there are no melee targets even when in combat. 
- Mercenary Clerics should no longer cast their spell haste buff on classes that have no mana. 
- Mercenaries now appear with a ':' before their name in the tracking window, similar to pets. 
- Fixed a bug that allowed a mercenary to keep the effects of an aura permanently after the aura was no longer present. 
- Fixed a problem that caused some players that zoned slowly to not be able to unsuspend their mercenary after they zoned. 
- Mercenary healers will now only dispel buffs on enemies when in aggressive stance. Since aggressive stance isn't currently in the game (though it may return at some point) healer mercs will no longer be dispelling for now. 
- Mercenaries should no longer become bald after various illusions. 
- Added a new "Assist" stance for Journeyman and above tank mercs that allows them to operate in essentially a DPS mode. If the tank merc is in Assist stance and not designated the main tank it will not use any off-tanking behavior like it does when in Aggressive stance. It will attack whatever the main assist is targeting (or whatever it last attacked it there is no main assist) and continue to do so until the main assist switches targets. If in Assist mode and designated the main tank the tank merc should behave the same as it does in Aggressive stance. 
- Fixed a problem where if you had maxed out your buff slots, healer mercenaries would no longer heal you. 
- Fixed a problem that caused the AI to be blind to damage taken from certain spells like Blood Magic or Divine Arbitration. 
- Fixed a problem where mercenaries were counting toward the hit limit for rain type spells, causing them to have fewer pulses when in the area of effect. 
- Merc healers will no longer cure charmed pets. 
- Mercenary "in camp" radius is no longer a sphere. It is now more of a disc to help with problems of mercs healing, etc. when a puller is on a floor above or below. 
- Merc healer AI will no longer cast cure spells if somone in the group is at lower than 50% health. 
- Mercs will no longer move out of melee range of their target if they are casting a beneficial spells (heals, buffs). This should cut down on a fair amount of unnecessary movement. 
- Mercs should no longer run off to follow someone across the zone when their owner is set as puller. They will only follow another group member other than their owner if that other group member is within their awareness radius (about 200 ft.). 
- Fixed an issue with out of combat healing AI doing a lot of over healing. 
- PvP spell resist and duration values are now used when hostile spells are exchanged between a merc and a PC (for non PvP servers this only applies to the Arena). 
- Fixed an issue with merc suspend timers counting down too fast if a custom UI had multiple instances of the timer display. 
- Fixed a problem where mercenaries would go bald when removing an illusion and zoning. 
- After carefully watching mercenaries since SoD launch some balance changes are being made: 
-- You will no longer be able to suspend or unsuspend your mercenary while you are in combat. 
-- Journeyman mercenaries will now cast 96% resurrection. Apprentice mercenaries are limited to 90% res. 
-- Increased the stats of the Tank Mercenaries starting at the Journeyman tier. The values are tuned to be less than what an equivalently geared player would be but is higher than previous values for various mitigation and avoidance stats useful for a tank. 

*** Miscellaneous *** 

- Corrected a few Stability issues. 
- Implemented new Hot Zones! Franklin Teek in Plane of Knowledge will be happy to remind you of the current Hot Zones. 
- Modified the pathing in the old commons zone. 
- Fixed a bug that was causing power sources to only be drained when out of combat. Now they only drain while in combat instead. 
- The NPC buy/sell/bank window will no longer disappear when the game client is re-sized. 
- Made tuning adjustments (downward) on many NPCs that had higher-than-expected resistances to Physical Attacks (Such as the Monk Eye Gouge attack). These attacks should be much more reliable now. 
- Rathework guardians have moved out of the inner sanctum of the Rathe Council Chambers. 
- Guards in missions in Toskirakk and Kaesora will not be so easily fooled by hiding from them. 
- Players can now decline a group invite when they own a mercenary. 
- Fixed a problem that caused player traps (e.g., fadelure, fire rune, bonestitch fetish) to trigger on pets/mounts/mercs, causing all kinds of havoc. 
- The incorrect boosts to HP/mana/endurance have been brought back in line with what they should have been. Please see other posts on this subject for more information. 
- Fixed a bug that caused stun effects to wear off the moment mez effects did. This meant that if you stunned a mezzed mob, it would wake up immediately. Now it will not wake up until the stun wears off. 
- Fixed a bug that caused certain spells that triggered casting of more spells (like Spectralside and Unity of Spirits) to overwrite each other even though that was not intended. 
- Power sources will once again change the color of the affected stats in that slot. 
- The potion belt now conveys the cool down timers on potions. 
- The Emerald Sokokar will now behave like other familiars. 
- NPC Strikethrough will no longer penetrate defensive disciplines like Weapon Shield, Deflection, Deftdance, etc. 
- Fixed a client crash for the quest Arachnophobia. 
- Fixed an issue with proximity aggro. 
- Fixed a problem with certain AAs with illusion components that allowed them to be used with no reuse timer if you had another illusion on you. 
- Fixed a client crash when your pet got more than 30 effects on it. 
- Corrected an issue that caused guilded characters to be forcably placed in the guild voice channel upon zoning. 
- Changed the way charges are deducted from consumable click items. Now, if the spell on the item is beneficial and it does not land, the charge will not be consumed. 
- Drakkin should now revert to a walk/run animation after dismounting. 

*** Previously Hotfixed *** 

- Added the rank XIV potions to the appropriate vendors. 
- The Dragorn in Kuua have become strangely weaker. It appears the Muramite forces may have gained the upper hand. 
- Fixed the ability for many NPCs in Korafax, both mission and base zone, to allow them to summon as intended. 
- Ganak's advisors will now assist each other in a manner that does not alert as many of their allies. 
- Increased the spawn rate of many rare NPCs in Kuua. 
- Most rare ("named") NPCs in Seeds of Destruction zones will now summon players they hate. 
- Corrupted Beguilers in the "The Price of Knowledge" mission will now chose the most hated player to update the task instead of the most hated entity, which might have been a pet or a mercenary. 
- The "Holding the Fort" mission will now not spawn the attack until you first speak with General Vurig. 
- The tormentors in the task "Inside information" take longer to arrive once their numbers begin increasing. 
- Pallorax in discord will now start over if the players take too long to engage him after he moves between portals. 
- The adds in the "Showdown at the Crystal Core" raid will now spawn a bit more quickly. This is to raise the difficulty to be closer to the intended difficulty. 
- The dwarves in the Showdown at the Crystal Core raid now insist on staying near their post and will no longer chase players too far from their camps. 
- The Venomlord's event will now start over if players fail to engage him again within one minute of him becoming idle. 
- Merchant Woad now carries the new energeian supplies. 
- Replaced Broken Battle Blades with Sundered Blade Shards on forage tables. 
- Fixed an issue that prevented some items from being placed in the potion belt. 

*** UI *** 

- The target window should now align with bottom of the player window. 
- The font combobox in the options window should no longer be overlapped by the label "Confirmations". 
- Added Style_Tooltip to SIDL.xml this now allows for turning on or off the tooltip window for certain UI elements. 
- Alt + Left clicking buff icons should now display the information correctly. 
- Buff icons should now tile correctly in the Buff Window. 
- Added the ability for scroll bars to automatically hide when not needed (See Style_AutoVScroll and Style_AutoHScroll) 
- Tabs can now be hidden on tab boxes. 
- Added "TileLayoutBox" which allows for automatically laying out components in both the vertical and horizontal directions at the same time. This is similar to the Horizontal and Vertical layout boxes.

Here is the patch message from today (as outlined by Jourdian on the EQ Forums):

*** Highlights ***

Happy Holidays from the EverQuest Team!

A Frosty Experience Bonus: To help them celebrate the season of Frostfell, adventurers will be surrounded by a frosty bonus experience increase of twenty-five percent starting with Tuesday, December 23, 2008. The frosty bonus experience will remain until the end of Frostfell, Tuesday January 6, 2009. Enjoy the holidays!
Fan Faire Workshop Quests: At the 2008 SOE Fan Faire in Las Vegas, several EverQuest players got a chance to participate in a Quest Workshop where members of the EQ Development team walked them through the quest creation process. The following quests have been implemented this update:
Gyrospire Relocator: Researcher Stripcog has unearthed a device that will allow a being to teleport to the top of each of the gyrospires. Unfortunately, he needs the assistance of others to help get the device working again. This quest was implemented with the assistance of Shadowkiller of Stromm, Ledau of Prexus, and Brasse, Cheremoya, Palarran, Starrla, Xapp, Sumdaye and Numayre from The Tribunal.
Kicking Tail: Scribe Choone’s party, attempting to help Choone research a story for Gimblefixx, was ambushed and nearly wiped out, save Scribe Choone himself. Choone wants the players to thin out the minotaur warriors enough for his mission to continue, and especially to kill the big mean taskmaster known as Higoren. See Scribe Choone in Dragonscale Hills to find out more. This quest was implemented with the assistance of Hellbent of Firiona Vie, Nizgog, Aroraskie, Indico, and Rigss of Erollisi Marr, and Hulkling of The Tribunal.
Improved linkdead Recovery: We've decreased the amount of time linkdead players will have to wait to log back in because of a stuck character.
Improved camera control: We added the ability to rotate the 3rd person camera (the one you get when you use the mousewheel) using the left mouse button. This allows you to move the camera around your character without rotating the character.  This is very similar to the way 3rd person cameras work in many other games.
Hot Zone Tasks: In addition to reminding players about the current Hot Zones, Franklin Teek in Plane of Knowledge now offers tasks for the most recent Hot Zones.
TSS Flag Requirements Removed: Removed the flag requirements for The Serpent Spine (TSS) expansion raids to enter the raid zones as long as you are level 74 or higher. The person requesting the raids will still be required to have the proper flags to request the raid.
SoF Crystal Drops Increased: Increased the number of Oil Stained Crystals that are dropped at the conclusion of the final event in Meldrath’s Mansion from six to twelve. 
Lesson of the Devoted Improved: The Veteran AA Lesson of the Devoted will no longer be removed by death.
Bard Type 3 Augments: Added Bard type 3 augments to SoF and SoD faction vendors.
Weapon Ratio Changes: Some of the Seeds of Destruction (SoD) group weapons had their ratios further tweaked. This is a completion of some previous changes that didn’t quite make last Update.
New Icons for the Original Epics: With the newly discovered old set of icons, we gave the original epic 1.0s their intended art (for the original 1.0 epics that had one made).
Physical Resist Changes:  Made tuning adjustments (downward) on many NPCs that had higher-than-expected resistances to Physical Attacks (Such as the Monk Eye Gouge attack). These attacks should be much more reliable now.
*** Items ***

The Master Artisan Satchel should no longer display haste effect information when a haste item is placed inside it.
*** Spells ***

Made more tradeskill-created spells tradable on Firiona Vie.
Swapped the Earthen Embrace and Serpent Vines spells back to their proper items.
The effect from the Aura of Rodcet will now pulse every 6 seconds instead of being a persistent effect, allowing its effect to stack with Lich and Clarity lines.
The mana boost from the Aura of Rodcet now mimics the effect of Cantata / Chorus of Rodcet.
Puratus, Fulkitcher Weave, and Cantata of Courage spells should now work properly.
Bards will no longer have their mana drained by the spell Mana Ignite, though they should still take damage from the spell.
*** NPCs ***

Added some of the special resistances, like mez and stun, on the rare/named NPCs in Korafax, Field of Scale and Old Bloodfield.
Fixed an issue that was causing some mobs in Old Bloodfield to despawn unexpectedly.
Physical Resist Changes: Made tuning adjustments (downward) on many NPCs that had higher-than-expected resistances to Physical Attacks (Such as the Monk Eye Gouge attack). These attacks should be much more reliable now.
Rathework Guardians are now a good deal faster than they were before.
*** Quests ***

Implemented the Fan Faire quest "Kicking Tail." See Scribe Choone in Dragonscale Hills to find out more.
The Fan Faire quest Gyrospire Relocation has been implemented. Find Researcher Stripcog in Mechanotus for more information.
In addition to reminding players about the current Hot Zones, Franklin Teek in Plane of Knowledge is pleased to once again offer tasks that take place in these zones.
The Old Bloodfields quest called "Deliver the Message" is now a shared task. We also fixed issues that could cause it to fail to update.
Slowed down the respawn rate in the Permafrost Frostfell mission.
*** Raids ***

Increased the number of Oil Stained Crystals that are dropped at the conclusion of the final event in Meldrath’s Mansion from six to twelve. 
Removed the flag requirements for TSS raids to enter the raid zones as long as you are level 74 or higher. The person requesting the raids will still be required to have the proper flags to request the raid.
The Stasis room raid reset should no longer get stuck in a loop.
The Kaesora raid will now reset after 15 minutes or if all council members are idle.
The Ritualists in the second phase of the Kithicor raid will no longer damage the storyline NPCs while they are idle.  It should still be necessary to engage the correct group of ritualists shortly after the message: “A dark energy begins to build to the *direction* of the combatants.”  However, it should no longer be necessary to engage all of them simultaneously.
The area near the entrance doorway will no longer be a safe spot during the Mindblight raid.
*** AA ***

The Veteran AA Lesson of the Devoted will no longer be removed by death.
The Enchanter AA Self Stasis should be more reliable at removing players from combat as they enter stasis.
*** Mercenaries ***

Added a new /merclog command that logs information for the player's mercenary (if they have one) to MercenaryAILog.txt. This command can only be executed once per minute. Also, added a new "mercenaries" bug type to the /bug window. Any bugs submitted with this type also generates the MercenaryAILog.txt file (if the player owns a merc and the merc is not dead/suspended).
Unshrouding should no longer require an upgrade cost in cases where you have not gained a level.
Fixed an issue that caused a healer mercenary not to heal you if you temporarily interrupted the incoming damage (say, with weapon shield). 
*** Miscellaneous ***

Improved linkdead recovery: We've decreased the amount of time linkdead players will have to wait to log back in because of a stuck character.
If you attempt to login to the world when that account is already logged in, you will now be prompted as to whether you wish to kick off the currently logged in player.   The logged in player (if it is truly logged in and not link dead) will be prompted whether they wish to allow themselves to be kicked off.
When going linkdead in combat, a 30 second delay is enforced before the kick is executed.
When going linkdead while out of combat a 5 second delay is enforced before the kick is executed.
Improved camera control: We added the ability to rotate the 3rd person camera (the one you get when you use the mousewheel) using the left mouse button. This allows you to move the camera around your character without rotating the character.  This is very similar to the way 3rd person cameras work in many other games.
Corrected an issue that prevented further purchases after opening a Consigned Armor Bundle in the marketplace.
Corrected an error message if an account does not have a credit card on file for the marketplace.
Modifications have been made to messaging in order to remove the redundancy of messages popping up for funding the wallet.
*** UI ***

Buff icons from effects that are not removed by death should no longer disappear after receiving a resurrection.
Fixed an issue preventing targeting players or entities by clicking on their HP gauges.
Changing the volume in the in-game music player should now work correctly again.
