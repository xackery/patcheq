From the patcher:

Here's a sneak peek at the Game Update notes for Wednesday, August 12, 2009.  Please note that these notes may be updated before the update goes live! 

* * * Highlights * * *

- Giants Giants Giants: Angered by Norrathian adventurers' blatant disregard for Dragonkind, Tzudani, Emissary of Veeshan, has called adventurers to battle Norrath's greatest and largest foes. Amongst these behemoths there are the giants themselves, foes of the children of Veeshan and one-time rulers of Norrath. Standing in your path will also be massive constructs built by some to protect their homes and by others to destroy the world. Regardless of their origin and purpose, these giants stand ready, unafraid of your tiny blades and feeble magic. Challenge them with your raid force or fight them with but a single group if you are feeling truly brave. Fight against the greatest "big" foes of Norrath, from the Ancient Cyclops to the powerful Lord Brekt. Seek out Tzudani, Emissary of Veeshan in the Plane of Knowledge and heed the call.

- New Spam Filter: Added server-side SPAM filtering to reduce or eliminate bothersome noise in chat and in-game mail.

- Poison Component Drops: Poison component drops have been increased, mostly at the higher levels. At the higher levels it has been doubled, and the NPCs have been given a chance to drop 1 or 2 components. Humanoid rogues will drop 1 to 4.

- Client Memory Optimizations: The client now uses less memory and has several new modes of operation to allow you to configure memory usage versus performance.

* * * Items * * *

- Removed the Echo of Anger effect from the Discordling War Mask.
- Increased the AC on the tier 4.5 shields from the hard mode raids.
- Put the correct sharpshooting focus on the items with sharpshooting from the hard mode raids.
- Many items with Geomantra have had a shared recast timer added to them.
- The Aspect of the Brood item should now work more consistently.

* * * Quests & Events * * *

- Fixed a problem that could cause one of the chests in the Korafax raids to be killed by NPCs and therefore disappear.
- The gold abacus will now reward players who defeated any number of dragons during the Dragons, Dragons, Dragons event. Players who defeated all 20 dragons should remove their current Gold Plated Contact Spring and obtain a new abacus from the Distribution Facilitator in the Plane of Knowledge, as the rewards are now likely to be better. 

* * * Spells * * *

- Removed regeneration messages from several recently added buffs.
- Prolonged Destruction "charges" will no longer be consumed by spell procs or melee procs.
- Promised Recuperation will no longer be overwritten by inferior promised healing spells.
- The cast times on the Pure Wildmagic spells triggered by Wildmagic Strike will now match the cast times of Wildmagic Strike.
- The pets summoned by Rank II and III of Minion of Sebilis will now come equipped with the appropriate mod items.
- Changed the name of some of the common click effects to make the upgrade path clearer.
- Circle of Life and Circle of Mana effects have had their level decay removed.
- The Messenger Bane poisons have been given an extra tick of duration to make them more reliable. They still will not be perfect if you get a bad run. 

* * * Tradeskills * * *

- Poison component drops have been increased, mostly at the higher levels. At the higher levels it has been doubled, and the NPCs have been given a chance to drop 1 or 2 components. Humanoid rogues will drop 1 to 4.
- The Messenger Bane poisons have been given an extra tick of duration to make them more reliable. They still will not be perfect if you get a bad run.
- The Rogue vendor only poisons are now easier to make.
- The refining steps in the make poison skill are now easier. 

* * * AA * * *

- Resolved several conflicts with the Monk's Third Spire of the Sensei abilities.
- The description for the Shadow Knight AA Mortal Coil has changed to accurately reflect how the ability functions. 

* * * Mercenaries * * *

- Corrected an issue with the minotaur mercenaries that was causing them to spawn with 0 endurance.
- Corrected an issue with the Siren Mercenaries that was causing them to be less effecient then other healer mercs. 

* * * Spam Filter * * *

- We've added a SPAM filtering for chat.
- Messages flagged as spam will appear as "Soandso tells you, (SPAM)". Clicking the word (SPAM) in the chat window will display the filtered message.
- You may also completely disable the display of SPAM flagged messages in your Options->Filters page.
- Clicking someone's name in the chat window will bring up a menu that allows you to report what they said as either spam or not spam (in case the message was mis-flagged as spam). The information reported is used to refine the SPAM filter (it does not take effect immediately).
- In-game Mail can also be filtered for SPAM. Mail flagged as SPAM will have its subject replaced by "SPAM". Buttons have been added to the mail window to report emails as spam or not spam (in case they are mis-flagged as spam).

 * * * Client Memory Optimizations * * *

- The client now uses less memory and has several new modes of operation to allow you to configure memory usage versus performance.
- There are four modes of operation selectable in the Options->Display->Advanced window:

    Least memory usage--This is the most aggressive mode. It only loads graphical assets on demand (at the time they are needed) and is aggressive about unloading assets when memory usage goes up. In this mode you may see gray textures as things load.
    Balanced memory usage--This mode tries to minimize the visibility of gray textures while still being fairly aggressive about unloading assents when memory usage goes up.
    Most memory usage--This is the default mode. This mode loads all assets needed for a zone while you are zoning, but only loads what is needed for what is currently in the zone. This mode still consumed less than we used before the optimizations.
    Original--Loads all assets as before the optimizations. This mode should only be used as a fallback in case of problems with the other three modes. This mode will eventually be phased out.

* * * UI * * *

- Added a few new icons.
- Added in functionality to support the new Spam Filter system.

- Changed -

EQUI.xml

EQUI_ServerListWnd.xml 

* * * Miscellaneous * * *

- You can now map the mouse buttons 3-8 to in game commands in the Options->Keys menu.
- Fixed a problem where the train button was available for AAs that you could not afford to buy.
- Fixed a problem with bandoliers and attunable items.
- Fixed a problem in the bazaar where having separate versions of the same item with different charges and price caused the bazaar to only use the newer price..
- Updated to latest voice SDK.
- Fixed a problem with the right click effect on Vibrating Gauntlets of Infuse.
- Fixed a client crash when inspecting certain buffs.
- Fixed an issue that caused the welcome screen to take longer than necessary to come up. 

* * * Previously Updated * * *

- The algorithm used to generate rewards from the Living Legacy abaci has been changed. If you were one of the affected people, please obtain a new abacus in the Plane of Knowledge and re-click.
- Fixed a problem that could cause one of the chests in the Korafax raids to be killed by NPCs and therefore disappear.
- Fixed a bug that caused Pallorax not to spawn when he should.

Here is the sneak peek version of today's patch (from the patcher):

Ancient Heroes Game Update

*** Highlights ***

- Ancient Heroes: Old Man McKenzie, a frequent patron of the taverns in the Plane of Knowledge, thinks you adventurers have it too easy these days! Back in his day they didn't have all this fancy armor and magical weaponry, they relied on their wits and not a little luck to survive! Think you've got what it takes to survive in McKenzie's Gold era? Now's your chance to prove it! Enter McKenzie's world and take on the denizens of Nagafen's Lair, Permafrost, and Guk as they were originally meant to be played, at level 50!

Transform yourself into a character built to mimic the classic EQ experience before even the lands of Kunark had been discovered. Prove your mettle by besting the Undead Frogloks of Guk or the Kobolds of Nagafen's Lair, with up to 5 friends. Or if you're feeling especially gallant, gather a raid force and take down Lord Nagafen or Lady Vox! With all new rewards you'll want to conquer them all!

Below level 80? Seek out Franklin Teek who's hiring adventurers to slay creatures in the 'Hot Zones' of Norrath. Some say he is a 'fixer' for some unknown party, while others think he seeks to live vicariously through the escapades of others. All we know for sure is he always seems to have work for those in need, and he's willing to pay well to have it done! Completion of any one of Franklin’s ‘Hot Zone’ quests by December 1, 2009 will qualify you for the Ancient Heroes Road to Underfoot event. Get to the Plane of Knowledge to see if he has work for you!

Participate* in all three of the Road to Underfoot events and pre-order and purchase the expansion by December 1, 2009 and you'll be one of the first to experience EverQuest® Underfoot™!

- Giants Giants Giants!: Haven't participated in the Giants, Giants, Giants even yet? Don't fret, you now have a little while longer to fight against the greatest "big" foes of Norrath. Seek out Tzudani, Emissary of Veeshan in the Plane of Knowledge and heed the call while there's still time. Good Hunting!

- Character Transformations Potions on the Marketplace: We've added two new potions and a combo pack to the marketplace that permit you to transform your characters.

    *Potion of Amnesia - Using this item will allow you to change your character's name. Once you change your name the change is permanent.
    *Potion of Disgenderment - Using this item will immediately change your character's gender to the opposite of what it currently is.  This is a permanent change.
    *Witness Protection Pack - This pack contains a Potion of Amnesia and Potion of Disgenderment. Using the Potion of Amnesia will allow you to change your character's name.  Once you change your name the change is permanent. Using the Potion of Disgenderment will immediately change your character's gender to the opposite of what it currently is.  This is a permanent change.

- Norrath's Timeless Heroes Winners:  Tomeseeker Salkien in Plane of Knowledge has a new book with some interesting recipes celebrating Norrath's Timeless Heroes - Tharkis (Luclin), Acceber (The 7th Hammer), Jyve (Antonius Bayle), Merlu (Maelin Starpyre), Oriaas (The Tribunal), Rouan (The Tribunal), Souldor (Erollisi Marr), Straha (The 7th Hammer), Terminat (Maelin Starpyre), and Tnexus (Prexus).

- Existing poisons from Chalandria's Fang will start rotting.  The new poisons it creates will last longer.

*** Quests & Events ***

- Divine Barrier has been returned to the normal buff window pending further review.

From the patcher:

*** Hotfix ***

*** Events ***

People who have completed more than seven raids from Solteris, Meldrath's Mansion, Crystallos, or all but the first tier of Seeds of Destruction raids will impress him.  You must request a Nagafen or Vox raid from him or attempt to join one in progress for him to check your accomplishments and allow you to see the raid items.

- New Hot Zones are now available.  Speak to Franklin Teek in the Plane of Knowledge to see what new tasks he has in store for you.

     - Shaman have been granted the haste spell Alacrity.
     - Lady Vox will now leash to her spawn point should she find herself outside of her room. This has been changed to provide an encounter more in the spirit of the event.

- The classic raids will once again drop items instead of brews.
- Old Man McKenzie no longer remembers encountering the Corrupted Gnome Explorer in Guk.
- Old Man McKenzie's group tasks now require a minimum of three adventurers to obtain and all three must be present to open the chests.  The raid events will still require 12.

*** AA ***

- Glyph of Angry Thoughts should now always give you the full hate bonus as described.
- Harm Touch 1 – 10 will no longer refresh upon the death of the Shadow Knight. This is to make the ability consistent throughout the entire level range.


*** Zones ***

- The following zones are now Hot Zones providing new challenges and increased experience. Speak to Franklin Teek in the Plane of Knowledge to see what new tasks he has in store for you.

   - Level 20 – South Karana
   - Level 25 – Lake of Ill Omen
   - Level 30 – The Twilight Sea
   - Level 35 – Kedge Keep
   - Level 40 – City of Mist
   - Level 45 – Howling Stones
   - Level 50 – Veksar
   - Level 55 – Grieg’s End

   - Apparently while performing some end-of-the-summer cleaning, the doors within Howling Stones were left unlocked. It may be some time before a maintenance crew can be sent there again to lock the doors up tight. Use this knowledge as you will.
   - In addition, the spells protecting the entrance to Howling Stones have weakened, and adventurers of lesser skill and strength may find its halls now accessible.


*** UI ***

EQUI_Animations.xml - new dragitems

*** Previously Updated ***

- Both the classic raid tasks and the zones they take place in have been set to their intended maximum of 42 players.
- Removed the ability for mercenaries to accompany you on Ancient Heroes missions.  It seems that they don't much like being taken to a time when adventurers didn't carry coin around.
- The chests in the "classic" missions offered by Old Man McKenzie will now hang around a while longer once opened.

*** Items ***

- The Unscribed Glyph item will no longer charge AAs when granting glyphs.
- Fixed the possessive apostrophe issue with the Atathus` Warfire line of items.
- The Thick Banded Belt's sell-back price has been changed to match the price of other looted items.

*** Tradeskills ***

- Rouan's Draught of the Wanderer will now return a bottle and cork on fail instead of 20 bottles.

- Fixed a misspelling in a dialog from the Protector.

*** Spells ***

- Corrected description errors in the spells Theft of Pain and Phantasmic Reflex.
- Damaging cast procs (such as Sympathetic Lightning) will now proc only on damaging spells, rather than all detrimental spells.  This will prevent damage procs from triggering on debuffs and mesmerizing spells.

- The Second Spire of the Minstrels will no longer apply a damage bonus to procs or item clicks.  Any bonus it applies to DoT damage will be divided over all ticks of the DoT rather than adding its full amount every tick.
- The functionality of Mortal Coil has been changed slightly to prevent some unwanted effects in specific situations. The triggering of mortal coil now leaves a 'Mortal Residue' upon your body for a short time which will block the continual application of Mortal Coil. Most players will see no change in the way this AA behaves.

*** UI ***

- Added left-click functionality to player and group UI gauges when used in custom windows.

- NPCs that summon will now summon players to half of their melee distance in the same direction the player was in prior to summoning. The method used to calculate the position of the summon should correctly account for floor height and invisible zone walls. So players should not fall through the world after being summoned or be locked outside of zone boundaries.
- Fixed a calculation error that allowed a player to sometimes stand just outside of a rooted/summoning NPCs melee radius and not be summoned.
- Fixed a problem that caused the spell Doom of the Mephits to crash the zone when you had a mercenary.
- Fixed a problem with pets where they would not re-attack an NPC when instructed to after the NPC had charmed its owner and pet hold was on.
- Alternate currency that is in item form will now automatically be reclaimed when exiting a monster mission.

*** Previously Updated ***

- The requirement to enter Howling Stones has now been lowered to level 40 to allow Hot Zone access for relevant players.
- Fixed a problem that was preventing players that did not have the key from entering the dragoncrypt zone.
- Fixed a bug that would send characters below the world when zoning from Paineel to Toxxulia Forest.
- The clicknar in Toxxulia will now fight back.  They still have a very small aggro radius.

Here's a sneak peek at Wednesday's Game Update Notes (from the patcher):

*** Highlights ***

- AC and Attack values on food and drink will now be properly added to your character.
- Corrected the description on The Frightening Writ.  It now properly mentions that it grants access to a scarecrow mercenary rather than the title "the Haunted."  It will now grant access to the new title "the Gravedigger."  This title is retroactive - if you have already used your Writ, you will now have access to your Gravedigger title.
- All UI engine changes required by the expansion are now live.  Some patching of UIs may be required.   Most of the popular UIs should already be updated - check your favorite UI site.

*** Items ***

- AC and Attack values on food and drink will now be properly added to your character.
- Changed the way the Vibrating Gauntlets of Infuse and Vibrating Hammer of Infuse function in order to avoid the linkdeath issues that were possible before.  If you transmute them there will be a slight delay before you can transmute them again.
- The bard wind instrument focus on Icy Greaves has been increased to match the focus on other items in that armor set.
- Corrected a polarity issue with the Countersprung Enhancificator.  It should now behave as intended when it comes in contact with water.

*** Quests & Events ***

- Corrected the description on The Frightening Writ.  It now properly mentions that it grants access to a scarecrow mercenary rather than the title "the Haunted."  It will now grant access to the new title "the Gravedigger."  This title is retroactive - if you have already used your Writ, you will now have access to your Gravedigger title.
- Mercenaries will no longer count towards the minimum player requirements for missions they can not enter.
- The Broodmother in Bloodmoon Keep is no longer rootable.

*** UI ***

- A large number of UI optimizations have been put in place that should noticeably increase frame rates under certain circumstances.

- When "Auto Assist" is engaged, mercenaries should behave exactly as before with respect to what targets they use for attacking/healing.
- Using a tank mercenary with "Auto Assist" disabled, the merc will wait for the "Call Assist" button to be pressed before engaging any targets. When the "Call Assist" button is pressed, all targets currently on the group enemy list (that are in his awareness range) will be added as valid targets and he will begin attacking using the normal AI for determining targets.
- Using a healer mercenary with "Auto Assist" disabled, the merc will behave normally except you can press the "Call Assist" button to override normal rules for not healing pullers. If a puller is in the awareness range of the healer merc when "Call Assist" is pressed, it will have a 3 second window where it can drop a heal on them.
- /mercassist on -- Turns on mercenary auto-assist mode.
- /mercassist off -- Turns off mercenary auto-assist mode.
- /mercassist -- Calls for assist when your mercenary is not in auto-assist mode.
- Fixed an issue where players could cause their tank merc to attack other players' pets.

Here are the patch notes for the official launch of EverQuest Underfoot (from the patcher):

*** Underfoot ***

Welcome to EverQuest Underfoot, the 16th expansion for EverQuest!

The Underfoot centers around the Heart of the World. This is the vast magma ball that floats in the center of a hollow sphere that stretches across a great distance. Standing on any open interior portion of the sphere, adventurers can look up to see the massive, blazing ball of living lava. The sphere is large enough that while individual areas may have a "bowl" shape it is very minor. Lava flows into and out of the Heart of the World from volcanoes, lava tubes and crevasses all around the hollow sphere, like blood into and out of a heart.

The Plane of Underfoot is ruled by a curious being known as Brell Serilis, the Duke of Below. It consists of an elaborate system of caves and tunnels and is inhabited by all sorts of creatures, both good and evil, that normally dwell underground.

In his temple at the top of the tallest volcano, Brell spends his days making new races. Most he destroys, returning them to their primal clay. Some he makes into his servants. Recently things have changed. Conflict exists in the Underfoot. There are those who continue to worship Brell Serilis and those who feel abandoned by him.  Brell's presence is no longer felt in the plane, and in his absence much of the machinery that serves Norrath and other worlds is breaking down.

It is into this troubled realm that adventurers can now travel.

- New Content: New areas for adventurers to explore including Brell's Rest, Pellucid Grotto, The Underquarry, Brell's Arena, The Foundation, The Cooling Chamber, Arthicrex, Lichen Creep, Kernagir the Shining City, Fungal Forest, Volska's Husk, and Brell's Temple. Travel to the Underfoot solo, with a group, or in raids to complete new quests, tasks, and events to acquire new items, spells, tradeskill recipes, and abilities.

- Extended Target Window: Track friends and foes with greater accuracy. The target window now lets you assign people or group roles to specific locations on the window for easy re-targeting.  You can track main tank, raid tanks, main target, main assist, puller, etc., or just put a specific player or NPC in the window.

- New Achievement System: Display and manage your progress through the world of Norrath. The achievement system allows players to track various categories of their advancement such as levels, Alternate Advancements, quest completions, and other progression tracking events. At the launch of Underfoot, players can track their General, Tradeskill and Underfoot progression Achievements. 

    Open displays achievements you haven't completed yet.
    Complete lets you toggle the display of achievements you have already completed.
    Locked toggles the achievements you aren't quite ready to work on just yet. As an example, if you are level 30, you should be focusing on obtaining level 40 instead of level 50.  In some cases, like quest lines, you may be able to complete locked achievements. This helps direct the players to content they should be focused on for their level and progression stage.

- Master Tradeskilling: Create powerful new weapons, armor, food and drink items, poisons and more.


*** Highlights ***

- EverQuest Underfoot is now open to everyone who has purchased it!  We hope those of you who qualified enjoyed the preview.
